            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Sermons being Occaſional, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by Matter of Fact that ſome were guilty in the Matter whereof this Book treats, I thought good to Diſcourſe of this Sin of <hi>Fornication,</hi> opening the Nature of the Sin, and diſplaying the greatneſs of its Guilt, to the intent that thoſe who are guilty of it may be brought to Repent, and thoſe that are not guilty may take Warning and avoid it: In doing which I had no other Deſign but that of the greateſt Charity to their Souls, and the Diſcharge of my own Duty and Conſcience, as not willing to have the Blood of any upon my Head, nor their Souls required at my Hand; for I dread that Threatning of God, <hi>Ezek. 33.8. When I ſay unto the wicked, O wicked Man, thou ſhalt ſurely dye; if thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked Man from his way, that wicked Man ſhall dye in his iniquity, but his Blood will I require at thine Hands.</hi> And this Sin being ſo common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral throughout this Kingdom, I thought theſe Diſcourſes might be neceſſary to be publiſhed for the benefit of the poorer ſort and vulgar Capacities,

And I heartily pray to God this Diſcourſe may be effectual for the turning of many Souls unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life that have been guilty of this Sin of Fornication; and that they may keep themſelves clean and undefiled Members of Chriſts Body, is the hearty Prayer of</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62831:6"/> 1. I begin with the firſt, <hi>What the Sin is,</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here exhorts to fly, and that is Fornication. And here before we define the <hi>Thing</hi> to be avoided, it may not be amiſs to diſtinguiſh of the <hi>Name</hi> of the Sin which we are to avoid.</p>
            <p>There is a twofold <hi>Fornication,</hi> a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Fornication.</p>
            <p>The firſt, <hi>Spiritual Fornication,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> defines thus, <hi>Spirituè, fornicatio eſt, deſecto Deo, adhaerere Diabolo,</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fornication, is a forſaking of God, and an adhering to the Devil. As they do that worſhip not the true God, but Stocks and Stones, Images of Wood and Stone, yea, or of Gold and Silver, or whatever other Materials: and in ſhort, it is the ſame with that, and all one with the Sin of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (that is, the People and Inhabitants of it) in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3.9. that <hi>through the lightneſs of her whoredom ſhe defiled the land, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adultery with ſtocks and stones;</hi> that is, had worſhipped Images and Idols: in which ſenſe alſo we are to underſtand her <hi>playing of the harlot,</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 8. So in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou haſt alſo taken the fair Jewels of my gold, and of my ſilver, which I had given thee, and madeſt to thy ſelf images of men, and didſt commit whoredom with them;</hi> that is, thou didſt fall down and worſhip them, commit Idolatry with them: which doing is again called <hi>opening of the feet,</hi> and <hi>committing fornication,</hi> and <hi>playing the whore</hi> and <hi>harlot,</hi> v. 25, 26, 27, 28. &amp;c. And ſo when heathen <hi>Rome</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>great whore,</hi> Rev. 17.1. <hi>with whom the Kings of the earth have committed fornication,</hi> v. 2. the meaning is, That it was a very idolatrous City, a City very much given to the Worſhip of Heatheniſh Gods, Images and Idols; and that from thence many other Kingdoms had been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their idolatrous courſes, if they had not alſo had ſomething of their Idolatry, falſe and ſuperſtitious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip propagated to them from thence. In this Notion I do not conceave this Word to be taken in the Text. Yet foraſmuch as it is the Duty of Chriſtians, and of all Men, to flee this Fornication alſo as well as the other, namely, that of the Body; and being it lies ſo pat in my way, I will ſpeak ſomewhat, though very little of what might be, of this Fornication alſo.</p>
            <p>Now touching this, the Unlawfulneſs of it, and ſo ours, and all Mens neceſſity of avoiding it, may appear from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62831:6"/>the Scripture directly forbidding it, and commanding our abſtaining from it, or our avoiding of it. Such is that in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.1. <hi>Ye ſhall make you no idols, nor graven image, neither rear you up a ſtanding image, neither ſhall you ſet up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it.</hi> Such again is that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.45. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou ſhalt not bow down thy ſelf to them, nor ſerve them.</hi> So that Gods People were to make no Idols, nor Images for themſelves to worſhip and ſerve.</p>
            <p>But what if they found ſuch things ready made to their hands, by others in the Countrey whither they were to come, might they not then worſhip and ſerve them?</p>
            <p>No ſuch matter: There is a direct Prohibition of this too, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt not how down to their Gods,</hi> (i.e. the Gods of the <hi>Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, Hivites,</hi> and <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> whoſe Land they were to come into, and take to themſelves in Poſſeſſion; to them they were not to bow down) <hi>nor ſerve them, nor do after their works: but thou ſhalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.</hi> Thus is ſpiritual Fornication the Sin of Adultery, or the worſhipping of Idols, that is, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of true of ſuppoſed Men or Gods, forbidden in the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And accordingly in the New Teſtament we meet with Prohibition of it, and Dehortation from it. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.6, 7. having ſpoken of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> of old, and touched of their evil doings, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings too for their doing ſo ill, in order, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Sufferings, to deter us from their doings; <hi>theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted,</hi> v. 6. he comes in, <hi>v.</hi> 7. to dehort particularly from Idolatry, and not to be followers of them in that Sin, leſt we ſhould follow them in their Sufferings for it; <hi>Neither be ye ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> as were ſome of them. And again in <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Wherefore my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.</hi> And ſo St. <hi>John</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fornication, <hi>Little Children,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>keep your ſelves from idols. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62831:7"/>
            <p> And in the ſteps of theſe Apoſtles of Chriſt did the Primitive Saints and Fathers of the Church walk. Hence St. <hi>Cyprian, Quid te ad falſos Deos humilias &amp; inclinas? Quid ante inepta ſimulachra &amp; figmenta terrena captivum corpus incurvas?</hi> Why doſt thou humble, and bow down thy ſelf unto falſe Gods? Why doſt thou bend thy captive body before fooliſh Images, and earthly figments? <hi>Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que idola, quae humanus error invenit: Ad Deum converte, quem ſi imploraveris, ſubvenit;</hi> Leave the Idols which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man errour hath invented, and turn thy ſelf to God, who will aſſiſt thee, if thou implore his aid for help. And ſo St. <hi>Auſtin, Nulla imago Dei coli debet, niſi illa quae hoc eſt &amp; ipſe;</hi> No Image, no not of God himſelf, to be worſhipped, but that which is the ſame with himſelf, that is Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, who is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the brightneſs of his glory,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the expreſs image of his perſon,</hi> Heb. 1.3.</p>
            <p>Thus both Scriptures and Fathers are againſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Spiritual Fornication, which ſtands in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Idols and Images. They that are guilty of this kind of Idolatry, do with God, as Whores do with their Husbands, forſake him, and follow, and ſerve other loves: they give the Glory of the Creatour to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>worſhip and ſerve the Creature more than the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who is bleſſed for ever, Amen.</hi> This is a juſt cauſe and ſufficient reaſon for us to ſtand off from Communion with any Church (be it <hi>Roman,</hi> or other) where this ſpiritual Fornication, the worſhipping of Idols and Images is made to be a part of the Religion of that Church. And we may well look upon any ſollicitations with ſuch a Church, as on ſo many Allurements and Enticements to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſpiritual Fornication and Adultery.</p>
            <p>We have great cauſe to bleſs God for his Mercy to us, in delivering us from an idolatrous Community, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the Communion of a Society of pure Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God. As the Caſe ſtands with us in reſpect of the Object of our Worſhip, we have nothing propoſed to be adored by us, but what every body acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be worthy of all Adoration, that is, the One only true God, and the ever bleſſed Son of God, who is one with the Father, the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. No Idols, no Images, no Pictures, are preſcribed, or propoſed unto us, to worſhip, or bow down unto. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62831:7"/>of that ſpiritual Idolatry are we enjoyned as part of our Worſhip, or ſo much as invited unto in our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping. All that is ſaid to us, is that which was ſaid unto us by the Angel unto St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 22. <hi>Worſhip God.</hi> So that in this reſpect the Members of our Church can worſhip God with a clear Conſcience, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of Mind, or riſing of Heart at what we worſhip, as there muſt needs be in thoſe who are compelled to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that which they cannot but know is no God; yea, is that which they may revile and ſpit upon, offer any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Indignation unto, without any prejudice at all unto themſelves. God give us Eyes to ſee the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Mercy, and Hearts to value it according to the greatneſs of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give ſome Conſiderations to perſwade all to flee this Idolatry, and to abſtain from this kind of ſpiritual Fornication.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a <hi>Great Vanity:</hi> for it is a doing of ſervice to that from which can come no good; neither protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from evil, nor acquiſition of good. For what is the Idol or Image that is worſhipped? A very nothing as to any thing of Deity ſuppoſed to be in it. <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that an Idol is nothing in the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.4. Now of nothing, what but nothing is it that can come? Hence that Sarcaſm uſed by the Lord to the Idols of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 41.23, 24. <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good or evil, that we may be diſmayed, and behold it together. Behold, ye are of nothing, and your works of nought. Lactantius</hi> gives three Accounts of the vanity of Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Idols that are worſhipped are the Images of dead men. <hi>Est autem perverſum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; incongruum, ut ſimulachrum hominis à ſimulachro Dei colatur:</hi> But it is a perverſe and unſeemly thing, that the Image of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, ſhould worſhip the Image of a dead man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe ſacred Images <hi>(imagines ſacrae quibus vaniſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi homines ſerviunt, omni ſenſu carent, quoniam terra ſunt)</hi> which thoſe vain men that worſhip Idols, do their ſervice to, are ſenſeleſs things, as being nothing in the world but Earth. <hi>Quis autem non intelligat nefas eſſe rectum animal cervari ut adoret terram?</hi> And who can but think it a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous at leaſt, if not a very wicked thing, for a man that was made upright, to bow himſelf to worſhip earth? which was therefore put under our Feet, <hi>ut calcanda à
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62831:8"/>nobis, non adoranda ſit;</hi> to the intent we ſhould tread on it, and not be Worſhippers of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe Spirits, the Devils, which are worſhipped and ſerved in the worſhipping and ſerving of Idols, are baſe abject things, thrown down by God from Heaven to Earth, and below that, even to Hell, and are both unable to do any thing of good for thoſe that ſerve them, becauſe the power of diſpoſing of all things in the World that are good, is Gods: So that as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights,</hi> (Jam. 1.17.) and are willing to do them all the hurt they can, and to that end, <hi>mortiferis eos illecebris &amp; erroribus perdent,</hi> they work their undoing by drawing them into, and entangling them in deadly Errors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are led away from the ſeeking after the true God. Beſides, to thoſe that ſerve the true God in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs, thoſe Spirits are ſo bruiſed under their Feet, that they are ſubject to them, and not able to abide in any place or perſon, whence they will expell them, as was evidenced by infinite of Inſtances in the primitive times, and even in times of late date. So that it is a great incongruity, yea, a very vanity for a man to make himſelf a Vaſſal to that which God hath put in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto himſelf; and that ſo for to worſhip an Image conſecrated it, which yet had been no Image, had not himſelf made it one; and which when made, he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make again at his pleaſure, and in the mean time uſe or abuſe as he pleaſes, without any Prejudice to himſelf by any Indignity put upon it. So that from hence Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip appears to be a very great Vanity. But that is not all. For,</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a great <hi>Impiety,</hi> a crimſon Sin, a Sin of a deep guilt, of a heinous nature, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Sin exceeding ſinful. And that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade from the commiſſion of it. He that conſiders it will be apt to ſay, when tempted to this ſpiritual Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid when tempted by his Miſtreſs to carnal Fornication, <hi>How can I do this great evil, and ſo ſin againſt God?</hi> The greatneſs of which Sin will appear in theſe following accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Work of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and ranked among the fouleſt of Sins, ſuch as <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Witchcraft,</hi> Gal. 5.19. if like its Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is bad enough.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62831:8"/> 2. It is made the meaſure whereby to judge of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Rebellion, and ſtubbornneſs againſt God; and ſo muſt be a Sin as great as that is. And who but thinks that a Sin exceeding ſinful? For <hi>Rebellion</hi> (ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> unto <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.23. <hi>is as the ſin of witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſs is as iniquity and idolatry.</hi> A clear evidence of its being a great Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is accounted <hi>Whoring,</hi> and that after Devils (<hi>Levit.</hi> 17.7.) and called by the name of <hi>Whoredom,</hi> and <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and playing the harlot,</hi> as is ſhewed above, it is no leſs Sin than carnal Whoredom and Fornication.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a Sin wherein is great unfaithfulneſs, and that with God. Hence it is ſaid of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.57, 58. <hi>That they dealt unfaithfully like their Fathers,</hi> that is, with God: <hi>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealouſy with their graven images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a hating of God. Hence in the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe that break that Commandment which is the direct Prohibition of Idol-worſhip, are ſaid to hate God. For <hi>God viſits the iniquities of the Father unto the third gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them that hate me,</hi> that is, that repel and refuſe him, and worſhip Idols inſtead of him. To be an Idolater is an horrible Sin, it is to hate God, that is, a Hater of him that is all Goodneſs it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a robbing of God. For it is a giving of Gods Honour unto that which is not God; he gives Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour away to an empty, earthly, dung-hill Deity, to a thing that is nothing. By all which, this Sin of Idolatry or ſpiritual Fornication appears to be a great Sin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a great Abomination unto God, an <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable thing that he hates,</hi> Jer. 44.4. Hence in St. <hi>Peter</hi> (1 Pet. 4.3.) we read of <hi>abominable Idolaters.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.8 of <hi>abominable Idols.</hi> The Image it ſelf is called <hi>Abomination</hi> unto the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.15. And ſo is he that <hi>chuſeth</hi> it for the Object of his Worſhip, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 41.24. And very <hi>abominably</hi> is King <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to have done <hi>in following idols,</hi> 1 King. 21.26.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is a thing abhorred by the Saints of God. <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> would rather be caſt into a burning fiery Furnace, than at the command of a King do worſhip to a golden Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17, 18. Yea, in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 97.7. there is a ſevere Imprecation made by the Pſalmiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Servers of ſuch ſenſeleſs Deities, <hi>Confounded be all they that ſerve graven images, that boaſt themſelves of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62831:9"/>Idols.</hi> Thus it was with the Saints under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And to tell how it was with the Saints under the New, were an endleſs Task. What was that that made all thoſe primitive Saints, whom we call <hi>Martyrs,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Priſons, Baniſhments, Famine, Whips, Scourges, Rackings, Burnings, and all the other Tortures and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo much talked of in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, but an abhorrency of Idolatry? Would they but have been Idol and Image-worſhippers, they might have eſcaped thoſe Cruelties, and have lived in Wealth and Honour. And ſhould we who believed what they believed, ever do that which they ſo abhorred, as that they would die any the cruelleſt Death in the World over and over rather than once do. O far be it from us ever to do any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>I may add here the Puniſhments that ſpiritual Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are liable unto; for it excludes them from Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church Militant and Triumphant, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to temporal Deſtruction, and eternal Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſhuts out from Communion with the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here on Earth. If a Chriſtian became guilty of it, if he were an Idolater in the Apoſtles days, Chriſtians were to have no Communion with him, not to <hi>keep company with him,</hi> not ſo much as <hi>to eat with him,</hi> but to avoid all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Converſe, not only ſacred but civil, with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Neither were Chriſtians to joyn with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their Worſhip, but to <hi>come out from among them, and to be ſeparate: the Temple of God having no agreement with the Temple of Idols,</hi> 2 Cor. 16.17. Nor were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to joyn with Chriſtians in their Worſhip (whilſt they continued Idolaters) but were to be <hi>without,</hi> not ſuffered to be in the holy City, the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Church to Chriſt on Earth, as Members of it, or Communicants in it. So the ſtate of that City or Church is deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. <hi>For without are dogs, and ſorcerers, and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and idolaters, and whoever loveth and maketh a lie.</hi> This ſpiritual Fornication keeps from coming into the Church, and turns out of it alſo ſuch as are in, are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; and therefore there is great reaſon for our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding it. But further, it excludes from Communion with the Church Triumphant in Heaven. Idolaters are of thoſe ſorts of Sinners that <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. Gal. 5.20. Eph. 5.5. No Inheritance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62831:9"/>in the Kingdom of Chriſt and of God for ſpiritual Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, for Worſhippers of Images and Idols. And who would make himſelf a Slave to a piece of painted or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Earth, to loſe thereby a ſolid Inheritance in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It expoſes to temporal Deſtruction, and eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Firſt, to temporal Deſtruction in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World. Thus <hi>Ahaz and all Iſrael was ruined by this ſin,</hi> 2 Chron. 28.2. <hi>They,</hi> the falſe Gods, the Idols of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> which that idolatrous King did ſerve, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto, <hi>they were the ruine of him and all Iſrael;</hi> that is, he and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ruined, brought to deſtruction by, and for that Idolatry of his and theirs. Long before that, whilſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in the Wilderneſs, <hi>three or four and twenty thouſand</hi> loſt their lives in one day about it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.9. and no marvel; for before that, at the very time of the giving of the Law, there is a direct menace of utter Deſtruction to any one that ſhould be guilty of this kind of Fornication. <hi>He that ſacrificeth unto any God, ſave unto the Lord only, he ſhall utterly be deſtroyed,</hi> Exod. 22.20.</p>
            <p>But further, it renders liable to Eternal Condemnation in the World to come: It damns even to the Pit of Hell. To prove this, it were enough to ſay, it ſhuts out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and if ſo, then it muſt needs thruſt down into Hell. For after this Life, <hi>duo ſunt loca, non eſt tertius ullis,</hi> there are but two Receptacles for them, Heaven and Hell; and there is no third place for any, at leaſt in St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Judgment. And as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31, &amp;c. the whole race of Mankind at the day of Judgment, are caſt but into two ſorts, <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats;</hi> that is, <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Reprobates:</hi> ſo no diſpoſing of any, but into two Sorts and Conditions, <hi>Everlasting Life,</hi> or <hi>Everlaſting Death;</hi> the one whereof is the ſtate of thoſe in Heaven, the other of thoſe in Hell. So that what ſhuts out of Heaven, ſhuts into Hell. But in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.8. it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>Idolaters,</hi> with other like wicked Creatures, <hi>ſhall have their portion in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſsecond death.</hi> Which what other can it mean, but that they ſhall be caſt into Hell, into thoſe regions of Darkneſs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, where is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth; where their Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62831:10"/>
            <p> In conſideration therefore of theſe things, let us ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all idolatrous Actions, and flee from all Acts of this <hi>ſpiritual Fornication.</hi> And as God is jealous of having any of his Honour given to any but himſelf, ſo we muſt abſtain from all appearance of every thing that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to jealouſy. Have we a care of hearkning to any that may ſeduce us, or of obeying any that may go about to enforce us to Idolatry, to be of that Religion which alloweth of it at leaſt, if it do not command and enjoyn the worſhipping of Images. Time may ſhew more need of ſuch an Exhortation, than at preſent ſome think there ſeems to be; in the mean time, if ever ſuch occaſion be, remember I have warned you.</p>
            <p>And this is all, which by occaſion of the Text, I ſhall think good to ſpeak of this firſt Notion, in which Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ſometimes taken and ſpoken of, namely, <hi>Spiritual Fornication,</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the <hi>Worſhipping of Idols and Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to ſpeak of Fornication in the ſecond No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and as it denotes that Sin which is alſo called <hi>Corporal Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this Senſe alſo it is taken ſometimes more <hi>ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and ſometimes more <hi>largely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſtrict</hi> Notion of it, as it is called ſimple Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo it is defined to be <hi>concubitus ſoluti cum ſolutâ,</hi> the lying together, or the carnal Copulation of two ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of the ſtate of Matrimony.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>large</hi> Notion of it, ſo it is defined more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be <hi>humanus illicitus concubitus,</hi> the unlawful Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man in any kind or reſpect.</p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Adultery,</hi> which is a diſtinct Sin from Fornication, and ſo ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. (where the Apoſtle reckoning up the Works of the Fleſh, begins with <hi>Adultery, Fornication,</hi> &amp;c.) yet is ſometimes underſtood by the word <hi>Fornication.</hi> Whence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, ſaving for the cauſe of Fornication, cauſeth her to commit Adultery;</hi> where by <hi>Fornication,</hi> in probability, is to be underſtood <hi>Adultery;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.9.</p>
            <p>Hence the word <hi>Fornication</hi> is ſometimes put to ſignifie the Sin of <hi>Inceſt,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>It is reported commonly, that there is Fornication among you, and ſuch Fornication as is not ſo much as named among the Gentiles.</hi> What is that? why the inceſtuous Marriage of a Son with the Wife of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>that one ſhould have his Fathers Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62831:10"/>
            <p> And ſo when the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. that it is <hi>the will of God that we ſhould abſtain from Fornication;</hi> it is evident by the oppoſing <hi>Sanctification,</hi> that thereby is meant all Uncleanneſs in general. Suitably whereunto it is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 7. that <hi>God hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs:</hi> So that as by <hi>Sanctification</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 3. we are to underſtand <hi>univerſal holineſs,</hi> ſo by <hi>Fornication</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Verſe we are to underſtand <hi>univerſal uncleanneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion now is, in what Senſe the Word is to be taken in the Text, whether in the ſtricter, or larger accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it; as it means <hi>ſimple Fornication,</hi> or any <hi>Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in general.</p>
            <p>And to that I anſwer, That according to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Apoſtle doth direct his Diſcourſe againſt ſimple, or properly ſo called, Fornication; and that in that Senſe we are to underſtand it.</p>
            <p>Not as if the Apoſtle were not againſt all Acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and had not as much mind to forbid them as this; but becauſe, whereas other acts of Uncleanneſs, as Adultery, Increſt, Sodomy, and even Rapes, were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sins by the Heathens themſelves, and unlawful; yet this ſimple Fornication, or the carnal Copulation of two ſingle perſons, was not looked upon by them as unlawful, or any Sin; and even the Chriſtians of thoſe times were by the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> Hereticks, then rife in the Church, attempted to be abuſed into the like apprehenſion of it. And this was the reaſon as <hi>Aquinas</hi> gives it, why Fornication was particularly forbidden the Gentiles in that Canon framed by the Council of the Apoſtles aſſembled at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 15.29. becauſe the Gentiles did not think that to be any Sin. <hi>Fornicatio autem prohibetur ſpecialiter, quia Gentes non reputabant eam eſſe peceatum.</hi> (as. q. 103. a. 4. ad 3.) So that the Apoſtle is to be underſtood here, as if he had ſaid, Such Cleanneſs and Holineſs ought to be in your Converſation, that ye ought to abſtain, not only from thoſe higher, and moſt groſs acts of Uncleanneſs which ye do condemn, as Inceſt, Adultery, Buggery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but even from that lower and moſt ſimple act of it, which is known by the name of Fornication, and which ye do allow of. It is not enough that ye be not inceſtuous Perſons, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, buggerers, or Adulterers, but ye muſt not ſo much as be Fornicators, ye muſt flee this too, as well as them.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62831:11"/>
            <p> Now hence will follow, that if Fornication the loweſt ſort of Uncleanneſs, that wherein there was thought to be no Sin, if that muſt be avoided, if not ſo much as that may be allowed to men, or indulged to Chriſtians, then much leſs may any of the other Sins of a deeper guilt, and of a more heinous nature, be dared to be committed, but muſt be utterly declined and abſtained from.</p>
            <p>So that the Apoſtle in requiring to <hi>flee Fornication,</hi> tho' in the ſtrict Senſe of the Word, hath ſpoken as fully and effectually, as if he had either particularly required to flee every other Act of uncleanneſs, or had in general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to flee and abſtain from them all. And thus we have ſhown what the Sin is which we are here by the Apoſtle required to flee, which was the firſt part of our Undertaking.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Proceed we now to the ſecond, which is to ſhow <hi>how it is that we are to flee this Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this I anſwer, That we are to flee it two ways; in <hi>Action,</hi> and in <hi>Affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, We are to flee it in <hi>Action;</hi> that is, we are neither to act it, nor any thing of it in our Bodies, but we are to preſerve our whole Bodies, and every Member of them pure and chaſt, free from all deſilement by any unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whatſoever; not thinking it enough that we do not commit uncleanneſs with our Bodies in the Act it ſelf of carnal Copulation, unleſs we do alſo abſtain from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy acting with any part of our Bodies, as our Eyes, Tongues, Ears, or Hands.</p>
            <p>We muſt flee Fornication with our <hi>Eyes.</hi> We muſt have chaſt Eyes, <hi>not ſill our Eyes with Adultery,</hi> like thoſe in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>nor</hi> ſo much as <hi>look upon a Woman to luſt after her,</hi> Mat. 5.28. rather plucking out our <hi>right Eyes,</hi> than being ſo far ſcandalized by them, as be brought by them to offend in this way. No rolling looks, no wanton glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt be caſt out to entice unto Luſt.</p>
            <p>We muſt flee Fornication with our <hi>Tongues,</hi> abſtaining from all tempting of others of ſin by any ſtattering blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments, from ſpeaking any obſcene, filthy, bawdy words. So the Apoſtle charges the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap. 5. <hi>v.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Fornication, and all other uncleanneſs, or covetouſneſs,</hi> (that is, of acting inordinate Luſts) <hi>let it not once be named among you as becometh Saints; Neither filthineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting.</hi> Obſcene ſpeech, bawdy talk, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62831:11"/>ſome uſe by way of jeſt to move Laughter with; theſe by the Apoſtles Rule, are things that do not <hi>become Saints;</hi> and ſo are a kind of Fornication, one degree of it which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are to fly.</p>
            <p>We muſt flee Fornication with our <hi>Ears</hi> alſo. We muſt not hearken and give ear to others that would tempt us to uncleanneſs; not ſo much as hear them any ſuch thing, but turn away our Ears from, and be deaf unto any ſuch motion. We muſt not take any delight to hear the obſcene, filthy, bawdy, wanton Words and Songs of others, by which the Coals of Luſt are kindled in the Mind, and all the Body, as it were, blown up into a flame of unchaſt deſires. In this as well as in other Caſes, we ought to have regard to that Premonition of our Saviours in <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24. <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we are fly it with our Ears, ſo with our <hi>Hands.</hi> We muſt act nothing of Unchaſtity with them, but muſt abſtain from all filthy application of them to the Member of any other, and from making any filthy ſigns by them, of any unclean <hi>Deſires</hi> in our ſelves, or unclean <hi>Deeds</hi> we would have acted by others. As our <hi>Hands muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with Blood,</hi> ſo neither our <hi>Fingers with Iniquity,</hi> If. 59.3. But if our <hi>right hand</hi> ſhall ſcandalize us in this way, we are rather to cut it off, and caſt it from us, than be brought ſo to offend by it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20 In a word, in every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and in every Geſtury whereby we may act, or allure, or intice, or any way ſtir up and inflame Concupiſcence, we are to obſerve Chaſtity, and to act ſuch Mortification in all our Members, that our <hi>whole Body</hi> as well as our <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and be <hi>perſerved blameleſs,</hi> kept pure and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from all uncleanneſs. And this is the firſt way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to flee Fornication, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We are to flee it in <hi>Affection.</hi> As we are not to act it, ſo we are not ſo much as to affect it. <hi>They that are after the Spirit, muſt not mind the things of the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.5, 6. They that have <hi>rightly learned Chriſt,</hi> muſt not give themſelves over unto <hi>laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs,</hi> Eph. 4.19, 20. Thoſe <hi>Members of ours</hi> which are <hi>upon the earth, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs,</hi> or greedy deſire after unnatural or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enjoyments; that is, thoſe earthly Affections of ours unto theſe things (ſuch as are in earthly-minded men, who mind nothing of Heaven, but like bruit Beaſts, have their minds all on Earth, and ſet their Affections only on
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62831:12"/>earthly things, earthly Enjoyments, earthly, bruitiſh, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſures) whereby we are incited, ſtirred up, and provoked to filthy actings, theſe are to be <hi>mortified,</hi> Col. 3.5. to be ſubdued, and brought under, and not ſuffered to <hi>reign in our mortal bodies,</hi> ſo as that we ſhould <hi>obey them in the luſts thereof,</hi> and in obedience thereto <hi>yield our members ſervants to uncleauneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.12, 19. But as being <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims in this World,</hi> we muſt abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. yea, as being <hi>Chriſts,</hi> that is, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Members of Chriſt, we muſt <hi>cruciſie the fleſh, with its affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. In this not ſo much as thought is free, nor deſire lawful, but every unclean af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is ſinful, which therefore is to be abhorred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, and avoided by us.</p>
            <p>And this is the ſecond way wherein we are to flee For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <hi>viz.</hi> as in <hi>Action,</hi> ſo in <hi>Affection.</hi> And this is all I ſhall ſay concerning the ſecond part of our Undertaking, How we are to fly this Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We now proceed to the third, where we are to <hi>preſent you with ſome Conſiderations, preſſing you on by way of Motive to fly this Sin of Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the firſt is, The ſinfulneſs of it.</hi> That any thing is a Sin, is Motive enough to diſſwade from the acting of it, how delightful, or how gainful ſoever otherwiſe it might be. The leaſt of Sins is not to be committed for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the greateſt Goods; for even of thoſe who ſay, <hi>Let us do evil that good may come thereof,</hi> the Apoſtles tells us, that <hi>their damnatoin is juſt.</hi> And the more Aggravations that any Sin is capable of, ſtill more reaſon there is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the commiſſion of it. The greater Sin brings upon the Sinner the greater guilt, that is an obligation unto the greater Puniſhment. So that whereas ſome Offenders ſhall be beaten but with few ſtripes, others ſhall be beaten with many.</p>
            <p>Now Fornication taken in the ſimpleſt Senſe of it, is a Sin, and that a great one: A Sin it is, for it is the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of Gods Law, as being ſpecially forbidden, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by our Apoſtle in this Text, but alſo by a whole Council of the Apoſtles aſſembled and acting by Divine Authority at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 15.29. And ſo, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3. <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctificiation, that ye ſhould abſtain from Fornication:</hi> Yea, and the Law of Man too it is a Sin; lor thereby it is ſtrictly forbidden to be committed, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62831:12"/>thereby Puniſhment is ordained for, and inflicted upon the Committers of it, ſo that it is a Sin; and a great Sin it is too, as being chargeable with many Aggravations.</p>
            <p>As firſt, it is an acting againſt right Reaſon: ſo <hi>Aquinas, Fornicatio dicitur eſſe peccatum in quantum eſt contra rationem rectam.</hi> Then Reaſon is right when it acts according to the Will of God, which is the firſt Law, and higheſt Rule. Inaſmuch therefore as the Will of God is our Sanctification, and our abſtaining from Fornication, therefore this Sin is a Sin againſt right Reaſon, which in conformity to the Will of God dictates the quite contrary hereunto. so that it ſeems no man commits this Sin, who hath nor firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched his Reaſon, and ſo far turned himſelf into a beaſt, or worſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is an acting againſt <hi>Charity:</hi> inaſmuch as that due care which ought to be taken for the Iſſue of the begotten, is not attended unto, the ſatisfaction of a preſent Luſt, not the Propagation of a future holy Race, being the thing intended therein. Whence ſo many baſe-got Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are either murder'd as ſoon as born, or neglected, or ſtarved not long after their Birth, and commonly ſmally cared for all their life, as to either Education or Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, prefent Inſtruction, or future Salvation. Whence the Schools determine Fornication to be no leſs than a mortal Sin. <hi>Fornication ſimplex, cum contra bonum educendae prolis ſit, illicita eſt, ut etiam ſit lethale crimen;</hi> ſo <hi>Aquin.</hi> 25, q. 154. <hi>concluſ.</hi> 3. And our Church praying in her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany to be delivered from <hi>Fornication, and all other deadly Sin,</hi> intimates Fornication in her account to be alſo a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sin. And by the Canon-Law the like Penance was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Committers of this Sin, as was upon thoſe that were guilty of Perjury, Adultery, Murder, and other like deadly Sins. <hi>[ib.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as againſt human Charity, ſo alſo it is a Sin againſt <hi>Chriſtian Purity;</hi> as being contrary to that Purity that was exemplified in the Life of Chriſt, and contrary to that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that is in the Law of Chriſt; contrary tog that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that in obedience to the Law, and in conſormity to the Life of Chriſt, ſhould be practiſed by all that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Chriſt himſelf lived a life of exact Purity, never guilty of the leaſt Inchaſtity in Act, in Geſture, in Word, in Thought. And his <hi>Will is our Sanclification,</hi> that we ſhould <hi>abſtain from Fornication,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſs our veſſel,</hi> that it, our Body, <hi>in ſanctification and honour, nhot in the luſt of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62831:13"/>even as the Gentiles which know not God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.3, 4, 5. And that we may know his Will, <hi>his grace that bringeth Salvation to all men, hath appeared, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. So that by the Goſpel we are called to be<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>Saints,</hi> that is, holy Perſons. And we are initiated into our Chriſtianity by a purifying Sacrament, the holy Sacrament of Baptiſm, where by the outward cleanſing of our bodies from their Filth by Water at their Birth, or entrance into Chriſtianity, is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified what Purity there ought to be in all our lives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is a beginning alſo wrought inwardly in us by the ſanctifying Grace of Gods Spirit accompanying the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance for the taking away of the filth of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the enduing us with inherent Holineſs: Whence that Sacrament is called, not only the <hi>waſhing of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but alſo the <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit,</hi> Tit. 3.5. 1 Pet. 1.2. Whereupon, <hi>as he which hath called us is holy,</hi> ſo it is our duty to be <hi>boly in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. <hi>To cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>to hate every garment ſpotted by the fleſh,</hi> Jude 23. and not <hi>(having eſcaped the corruption and pollution that is in the world through luſt)</hi> to be again <hi>intangled therein, and overcome,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and 2.20. <hi>The divine power hath given unto us all things that appertain unto life and godlineſs, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and vertue, whereby are given unto us exceeding precious promiſes, that by theſe we might be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature,</hi>2 Pet. 1.3, 4. Now what can be more contrary to this Purity, than this beaſtly<note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>rom.</hi> 6.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Jud.</hi> 8.18, 23. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.7.</note> Sin, which is ſo far from Purity, that it is the direct contrary thereto, and called by the name of <hi>corruption, uncleanneſs, pollution, filthineſs, the luſt of uncleanneſs, ungodly luſt, a ſpotting,</hi> and <hi>defiling thing.</hi> And what indeed is in the whole ſtory and buſineſs of it, but naſtineſs and beaſtlineſs, filthineſs and uncleanneſs, not to be ſeen by Chriſtian Eye, not to be ſpoken by Chriſtian Mouths, not to be heard by Chriſtian Ears: Whence the Apoſtle would <hi>not have it once named among Saints,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>it is a ſhame even to ſpeak of thoſe things,</hi> Eph. 5.3, 12.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62831:13"/>
            <p> And thirdly, It is a Sin againſt all the Perſons in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt the <hi>Father,</hi> in that it is a diſhonouring of his <hi>Creature;</hi> abuſing that to vileneſs, and baſeneſs, and bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, which he made for himſelf, and for his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory. Whence the Apoſtle cells us above, <hi>v.</hi> 13: that the <hi>Body is not for Fornication, but for the Lord:</hi> and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>v.</hi> 20. bids that we ſhould <hi>glorifie God in our Body,</hi> as being that <hi>which is his</hi> upon a double right; firſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after of Redemption; and therefore is only to be uſed according to his Will in all Purity, and not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed according to our Luſt in any Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt the <hi>Son:</hi> for it is a Diſhonouring, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing of a Member of him, even ſo far as to make it a Member of a Harlot. <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſays our Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>that your bodies are the members of Chriſt? Shall I then take the members of Chriſt, and make them members of an harlot? God forbid.</hi> As by Marriage the two Parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one in Body, ſo by Religion, which imports a holy tye of a Chriſtian unto Chriſt, Chriſt and the Chriſtian become one in Spirit, there is a ſpiritual Union betwixt them, as a civil Union betwixt married couples. But then Fornication is the breaking of this Union; for by a mans joyning himſelf to another, to a Harlot, he becomes one body with a Whore, which is a high diſloyalty againſt Chriſt, and a breaking off from Union with Chriſt, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of him to follow after, and be joyned with a Whore, which is a ſtrong Argument againſt this Sin; <hi>Memento quia Chriſto ſacrata ſunt menbra tua, nou miſceantur membris mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricis,</hi> Chryſoſt. O remember that your Members are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated unto Chriſt, and that is reaſon enough why you ſhould not commit Fornication, inaſmuch as that 'tis the making of your Members to become the Members of an Harlot or Whore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> For it is a diſhonouring and a defiling of his <hi>Temple,</hi> and a turning it into a Stve, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Den of Uncleanneſs. <hi>What,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle here <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt which is in you.</hi> So that this defiling of the Body, is the defiling of the Temple of the Hold ghoſt, and to a doing of deſpite unto that Spirit of Grace, a forcing him with our naſtineſs to forſake his Habitation, which is alſo a ſure way to bring on our Deſtruction. For, ſays our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62831:14"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy: for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple are ye.</hi> Now this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration raiſes up this Sin to ſo exceeding an height of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as that it ſeems not needful to add any thing more to ſhew the ſinfulneſs of it: And yet more may be ſaid to ſhew it.</p>
            <p>For it is a Sin againſt a mans own <hi>Body,</hi> and abuſing of a mans ſelf, a doing a <hi>Diſhonour,</hi> and Deſpite <hi>to their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> Rom. 1.24. And our Apoſtle argues by way of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to diſſwade from this Sin in the following members of the Text: <hi>Flee Fornication. Every Sin that a man doth, is without the Body: but he that committeth Fornication, ſinneth againſt his own body.</hi> The meaning is, That whereas moſt other Sins are againſt others, God or our Neighbour, this is a Sin againſt a man's own ſelf, whereby he defiles that part of himſelf into filthy abuſe, which was ſanctified by God to an uſe of holineſs, even to be the Temple of his moſt holy Spirit. It is a robbing of a man's ſelf of ſo great an Honour, and ſo great an Happineſs, as to have his Body to be the Temple of Gods Spirit; than which, what worſe Diſcourteſy, what greater Miſchief can a man do unto himſelf?</p>
            <p>And not only againſt himſelf, but it is a Sin alſo againſt the body of <hi>Another,</hi> the Body of her with whom Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is committed, as well as his own Body: It is a doing to her as much miſchief as to himſelf, bringing as great a Sin upon her, and involving her into as great a ſhare of Puniſhment as himſelf. For this is a Sin that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be committed by one; there muſt ever be two at it. A man may commit Murder or Thieſt alone; he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear and lye alone; he may gluttonize, and be drunken himſelf alone, but he cannot play the fornicator alone by himſelf, he muſt have a Partner with him in his Sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doubles his Sin; as being guilty not only of his own act, but others alſo, whom he tempted to the conſenting to him in the acting of that filthineſs, which is a great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation to the ſinſulneſs of it. And yet neither is this all. For,</p>
            <p>In the next place, it is a Sin committed againſt clear light and knowledge, and ſo cannot but be againſt Conſcience. For the Scripture hath clear and plain Prohibitions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations from it, and Denunciations, or Threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62831:14"/>the Committers of it; which none can be ignorant of, that knows any thing of the Scriptures of God. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions and Dehortations we have mentioned before; and ſuch is this in my text, <hi>Flee Fornication:</hi> Such is that in <hi>Act</hi> 15.29. where <hi>abſtaining from Fornication</hi> is made a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Injunction upon all that would be Chriſtians. Such again that in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3. where it is declared to be <hi>the will of God, that we ſhould abſtain from Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for Denunciations or Threatnings, they are plain, nad clear, and full: Such is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Hib.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> Such that of his again in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. <hi>No Whoremonger, nor unclean Perſon hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God.</hi> So <hi>v.</hi> 6 <hi>For theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience.</hi> And to name no more, ſuch is that <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. where <hi>Whoremongers</hi> are of that number that <hi>ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not theſe clear and plain Prohibitions and Denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations? And do theſe lie fair and clear in our Books to read? And are they not frequently read in our Churches, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in our Congregations? Who then can plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, unleſs it be to excuſe one Sin with another, which nothing mitigates the fauſt, but rather greatens the guilt? So that this muſt needs be acknowledged a very great Sin, which is committed againſt ſo many, ſo clear, ſo known Declarations of the Will of God againſt it, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of the Wrath of God againſt the Commuters of it. And yet neither is this all. For,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Conſiderations of the Puniſhments threatned, and aſſuredly inflicted, unleſs prevented by a timely repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do as it were with a beam of the Sun, point out unto, declare and diſplay the greatneſs of the Crime, the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sin. Great Puniſhments are ordained for great Sins; ſo that in the greatneſs of the Puniſhment denounced, we may read the greatneſs of the Sin committed</p>
            <p>Now what is the Puniſhment denounced againſt this Sin? Why, firſt in general, the Judgment of God; That <hi>God will judge</hi> the Committers of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. Which, how far that may extend, God knows; being that remporal and eternal Judgments, all Curſes and Plagues both in this liſe, and in the liſe (or rather death) that is to come, may lie infolded within the arms of its Comprehenſion.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62831:15"/>
            <p> Secondly, Excommunication out of the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. <hi>With a Foruicator</hi> Chriſtians are <hi>not to eat,</hi> not ſo much as the ordinary Food of the Body, much leſs the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Food of our Souls; no, <hi>not</hi> ſo much as <hi>keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pamy with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.10. I know not what ſome may think of this, but ſure in the Primitive Times it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a heavy Puniſhment; inſomuch that they upon whom it fell, were reckoned of as Perſons <hi>delivered up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. As indeed he muſt uceds be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of Satan, who is expelled the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Excluſion out of the Church Triumphant. <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Adnlterers, nor effeminate Perſons, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind,</hi> are admitted to an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in Heaven; ſuch 'tis experſly ſaid <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.9, 10. And ſo again, <hi>Epb.</hi> 5.5. <hi>No Whoremonger, nor unclean' Perſon, nor covetous Man</hi> (which Expreſſion relates to matters of Uncleanneſs) <hi>hath any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Kigdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Condemnation unto the Torments of Hell. <hi>Whoremongers,</hi> among the reſt of theſe wicked ones, are threatned to <hi>have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 21.8.</p>
            <p>All which laid together, do ſhew the Puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt Fornicators, to be a very grievous Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that is Proof abundantly enough, that the Sin that it threatned with that Puniſhment, is a very grievous Sin, a heinous Offence, a Sin that is exceeding ſinful. And tho' we may flatter our ſelves with a hope of eſcaping for leffer Sins, and ſo out of that hope venture the more boldly upon the commiſſion of them; yet for ſuch grand Offences, mortal Sins, deadly Crimes as this, we cannot but be hugely afraid of ſuffering the deſerved Puniſhment. And therefore this may be one weighty Conſideration to preſs on by way of Motive to abſtain from this Sin, and to <hi>flee Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſecond may be the ſhamefulneſs of it.</hi> Things that are honeſt, pure, and lovely, and of good report, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and praiſe-worthy, thoſe are thing; for Chriſtians to think of, to have their Minds and Hearts upon; (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8.) But things of diſhoneſty, things that are ſhameful, and of evil report, theſe Chriſtians ſhould with the greateſt care that can be, avoid. And indeed if we conſider this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62831:15"/>Sin of Fornication in every Circumſtance of it, it is a very ſhameful Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Actors of it are aſhamed to be ſeen in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chuſe darkneſs and ſecrecy to act it in: <hi>In the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in the evening, in the black and dark night,</hi> as the Wiſe Man obſerved, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.9. Whence this, and the like Sins are called <hi>the Works of darkneſs,</hi> Eph. 5.11. done in ſecret, in private and cloſe Chambers; (whence <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wantonneſs</hi> go well together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13.) or other places of conveniency for privacy and ſecrecy, as furtheſt removed from Obſervation and Diſcovery: which, why need it be, if it were a thing of honeſty, if it were not a ſhameful thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Parts and Members of the Body wherewith the Sin is acted, are things which were a Shame to ſee or name. Whence the <hi>Greeks</hi> call them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the <hi>Latins, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda,</hi> ſhameful things; things which People that have any thing of Modeſty in them, are aſhamed to look upon. <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> when the Father ſo lay, that his <hi>naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appeared,</hi> took a Garment, and laid it upon both their Shoulders, and went backward, and covered it, without ſeeing of it; and for that Modeſty of theirs got their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>Bleſſing;</hi> whenas <hi>Cham</hi> for his Immodeſty, looking upon it, had his Father's <hi>Curſe,</hi> Gen. 9.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fall of our firſt Parents into Sin, was not ſo great as to take away from them all Shame: But as ſoon as they perceived themſelves naked, they had ſo much remains of Modeſty left them, as to make themſelves A prons, tho' but of Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, to cover themſelves withal, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. which God himſelf did after change into a better covering of Coats made of Skins, <hi>v.</hi> 21. God would not have <hi>an Altar with ſteps</hi> made up to it, leſt that aſcent ſhould be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diſcovering <hi>of the nakedneſs</hi> of ſuch as ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice thereon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.26. and gave ſpecial order, that for prevention of the like diſcovery in the Prieſts, they ſhould have <hi>linnen Breeches made them, reaching down from the loins to the thighs,</hi> Exod. 28.42. Hence (by was of alluſion) Raiment is counſelled to be bought by the Angel of the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> that the <hi>Sbame of his nakedneſs might not appear,</hi> Rev. 3.18, and he is pronounced <hi>bleſſed, that watcheth and keepeth his garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his Shame,</hi> Rev. 16.15. Throughout the whole Scripture thoſe Parts are never found mentioned by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62831:16"/>name, but by ſome other modeſt way of Expreſſion. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongſt the Heathens would the People of Modeſty have any of thoſe words in their Mouthe: The more ſhame for thoſe Chriſtians, whoſe delight it is, upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to mouth them in moſt immodeſt ſort. Of theſe People may it be truly ſaid, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of ſome in his times, That <hi>they glory in their ſhame,</hi> Phil. 3.19. or as St. <hi>Jude</hi> expreſſeth it, they <hi>foam out their own Shame,</hi> v. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thé Act if ſelf, wherein this Sin is committed, is ſo ſhameful, as that it cannot be mentioned in greateſt priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy without Shame; and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it as a thing <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>named among Saints,</hi> Eph. 5.3. and ſaith, <hi>it is a ſham to speak of thoſe things,</hi> v. 12. And well he might, as being a thing fitter for Bruits, as Dogs and Bitches, to delight in, rather than for Men. Whence<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>50.</hi> ad Ocean.</note> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> calls the acts of Fornication, <hi>Caninas Nuptias,</hi> the nuptical Weddings or Marriages of Dogs. And being a thing much delighted in by the Devil himſelf, ſo far as not only to make it a part of his Service, (in the performances whereof ſtood much of the Myſteries of his Worſhip) but alſo to practiſe himſelf, together with Men and Women, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed human Shapes and Bodies, as is ordinary among Witches.</p>
            <p>And if the Act it ſelf cannot be named without Shame, how ſhameful muſt we needs think the commiſſion of it? How can not only their Faces outwardly, but their Hearts inwardly burn and glow within them, whilſt they are acting ſo ſhameful a thing; a thing that can neither be ſeen, nor ſpoken, nor heard by others, who are no way guilty of it, without bluſhing at it,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The tempooral Puniſhment conſequent to this Act, is a ſhameful Puniſhment. Among the <hi>Grecians</hi> in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Greece,</hi> as <hi>Camerarius</hi> obſerves, the Puniſhment for Fornicators was, That the Fornicator ſhould have his Beard chopt off with a keen Ax, and ſo to be ſent away, which to him was a Mark of Infamy. Amongſt us the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for Offenders in that kind, to ſtand in the places of moſt publick notice (the Church during Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or ſome Market-Town in the time of throngeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62831:16"/>of People) with a white Sheet upon them, to be a publickSpectacle for all People to behold, and gaze upon, and ſo be the Town or Countrys talk, that I ſay not their Scoffs and Scorns; a thing greatly ſhameful to thoſe that have any remains in them either of Grace, or good Nature.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe things laid together, the ſhamefulneſs of this Sin appears to be very great; and the conſideration of that, may be one other weighty Motive to abſtain from the Commiſſion of it, and to <hi>flee Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A third may be the Toileſomneſs of it.</hi> Chriſtians are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Liberty and Freedom; and the greateſt Liberty in the World conſiſts in Vertue and Piety: For the more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and pious, the more free from Sin and Wickedneſs; to be Servant to which, is the greateſt Slavery in the World: no Tyranny like to that where Sin reigns. But as all Sin in general is tyrannous, and ſo the ſerving of it Slavery; ſo all Luſt in particular is very tyrannical, and the ſerving of it very drudgery: The Slave to that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is never at reſt, no not ſo much as in the Night, when other Slaves, tired with the Toil of the forepaſſed day, take their eaſe. And therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Flee Fornication,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de <hi>Cain</hi> &amp; <hi>Abel,</hi> cap, <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us he ſaid it, <hi>ut veloci fugâ tanquam furioſae dominae declinare ſaevitiam, &amp; tetro exitio exire poſſemus;</hi> that we might be moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to do our endeavour by a ſwift flight to avoid the Cruelty of a raging Tyranneſs, as it were, and get out of a moſt baſe Service: Sad is the Toil, heavy is the Drudgery of a Slave to this Luſt, <hi>Savus criminum ſtimulus, libido eſt, quae nunquam quietum patitur affectum;</hi> Luſt, the Luſt of uncleanneſs, is a cruel ſtinger on unto Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it never lets the Affection be in quiet. <hi>Nocte fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, die anhelat, à negotio abducit;</hi> as he goes on; it burns in the Night, and pants in the Day, it awakes from ſleep, and takes off from buſineſs; gives no reſt to its Slave, but ever inflames with enjoyment, and becomes more raging by uſe.</p>
            <p>How doth it buſie the <hi>Head</hi> with thouſands of thoughts about the obtaining of its deſire? What Plots, what Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, what Arts, what Stratagems, what Tricks, what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62831:17"/>Policies, what Ways, what Means doth it deviſe and frame for the compaſſing of its end? Eating, drinking, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waking, ſleeping, ſtill the mind is kept in action with muſing and meditating, pondering and ſtudying how to be made Maſter of its ſo longed-for Wiſh. How doth it fill the <hi>Heart</hi> with Crouds of <hi>Cares</hi> to put its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects into practice, and with throngs of <hi>Fears</hi> of Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in its Deſigns, and multitudes of <hi>Jealouſies</hi> of being defeated by any other counter plotting Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>What Watchings muſt there be of the Inamorates for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to open their minds, and diſcover their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? What ſolliciting, courting Complements with the Paramour to woo and win her to a Compliance with them in their Deſires? What promiſing, what vowing, what ſwearing of love to the attempted Miſtreſs, when there is no more of Love in them to her, but a bruitiſh, unruly, longing Deſire to ſatisfie their Luſt only?</p>
            <p>What a waiting muſt there be? What attendance muſt many times be given before their Suit can have its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, if they have to do with a Perſon that is proud and coy, or covetous and conning; who for pleaſing of her humour, or for the advancing of her gain, will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them with a thouſand delays, and keep them in hand with variety of Shifts and Put-offs, as tedious and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom as thoſe meet withall that go to Law; this Evening, or that Morning; this Afternoon, or that Midnight muſt be waited for, and attended on, and over and over, and all to no purpoſe through ſome accidental or contrived diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>
            <p>O, who is able to endure ſuch Drudgery as this! One ſeeing a Harlot going in her Gaiety to the Theatre, wept to think what pains the Wicked took to go to Hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as himſelf took no near that pains to get to Heaven. Were thoſe Thoughts and Cares to be-ſpent in making our peace with God, which theſe People ſpend in gaining a Whore to their minds; were there to be that watching and waiting for the ſaving of our Souls, which theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons undergo for the ſatisfaction of their Luſts, we ſhould think the price of Salvation intollerably too dear. Weight but how weariſome a thing it is to moſt men but to ſay a few ſhort Prayers Morning and Evening, or to read a Chapter or two once in a day, or to attend once or twice
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62831:17"/>on Gods Day in Gods Houſe at the Service of God; how long the Prayers are thought? how tedious the Sermon? how tireſome the whole Duty? Some have not patience to ſit it out, and therefore either come not at all to it, or elſe come ſhort of much of it, or ſleep and drowze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way moſt of their time whilſt they are at it. Oh, what would they think, what would they ſay, if they were to wait hour after hour, day after day, night after night upon Gods Service? Oh, how toilſome then muſt be the Service of Luſt? how tireſome the Sin of Fornication, which exacts theſe Drudgeries from its Servants? that they muſt ſpend Nights and Days about it; buſy their Wits, and break their Sleeps with it, take little or no reſt Day or Night for it.</p>
            <p>This, with conſidering perſons, cannot but be very weighty to ſtop them from going into, or turn them back from going on in ſo troubleſome a way, ſo toilſome a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, ſo weariſome a drudgery in the Service of ſo baſe a Luſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A fourth is the Expenſiveneſs of this Sin.</hi> A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Whoremaſter at a ſmall Charge: He that drives that Trade, had need to have a good Stock to ſet up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; for he ſhall find it a coſtly Sin, a Sin that will waſte him to the Bones, if he follow it any thing hard, whereof we have infinite Examples in our Times and Countries to aſſure us.</p>
            <p>What a deal of Expence goes in the <hi>Price</hi> of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, eſpecially where the Whore drives a Trade with their Bodies. <hi>Flora</hi> the Harlot got by that Trade ſuch an Eſtate, as the City of <hi>Rome</hi> diſdained not to become Heir unto. <hi>Lais,</hi> the Harlot of <hi>Corinth,</hi> had ſuch a rate for a Nights lodging with her, as men of great Eſtates were afraid to give: Ten thouſand Drachms (a great Sum, if it were but ſo many of our Groats) did ſhe demand of <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> for the pleaſure of her Company for one Night, though he had the wit not to buy Repentance, as he ſaid, at ſo dear a rate. And no doubt but the Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of our days pay dear enough in this way for their vain Pleaſure and lewd Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>What a great deal of Expence muſt go in Treatments,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62831:18"/>and Entertainments of the Whore? What in Plays and Revels, Feaſts and Banquets, Wine and Preſents, to allure and oblige her? What in Gifts and Bounties to thoſe about her? What in Pay to, or Expences on Pimps to procure her? What in Bribes to Privadoes for Opportunities of acceſs to her, and for ſecrecy of Converſe with her? The Hand is never out of the Purſe almoſt, for fetching out one Expence or other in theſe things of this Nature.</p>
            <p>What a great deal again goes in high Diet, provokative Drinkes, Confectionary Philters, and all manner of Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Incendiaries unto Luſt? What again in Charges for Cure of the <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſes gotten by thoſe ways of filthineſs? And that (to name no more) muſt go in Fees by way of Commutation, to buy off that ſhameful Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by the Law is to paſs on thoſe who are guilty in this kind, where the Fault is known, and the Offender proſecuted againſt?</p>
            <p>How many fair Eſtates do we ſee daily melted and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred away to nothing by theſe means? Men of good Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Heirs of fiue Lands, are in a ſmall time brought to Penury and Beggery by this way! He that is now rich, may in a little ſpace whore away all he hath, and be brought, like the Prodigal in the Goſpel, to be glad to eat Husks with the Swine for Hunger, if he knew how to get them. So vaſtly, ſo vainly expenſive a Sin this is.</p>
            <p>Now this Conſideration to perſons that have any thing of Wit or Underſtanding, may be a very preſſing Motive to reſtrain them from following ſo baſe ways as theſe. When they ſhall conſider how expenſive thoſe ways are, and at what rate they muſt buy Repentance, they cannot but think theſe are no ways for them to go on in, unleſs they deſign to ruin and undo themſelves for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A fifth Conſideration</hi> to hinder or withdraw ſo vicious a Courſe, may be, that it is an unprofitable Luſt, <hi>a fruitleſs Sin.</hi> Ambition gets Honour, Covetouſneſs gets Wealth; Gluttony, good Chear; Drunkenneſs, good Liquor; but what gets the Fornicator? nothing that I know that is good. It is a Sin that brings in o Profit, unleſs it be to the Whores that make a Trade of it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſo the Apoſtle asks to Queſtion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> having ſpoken but newly before of their yielding their members Servants to uncleanneſs; <hi>What fruit had ye then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62831:18"/>in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> What can the Fornicator ſay he hath gotten after all his Thought, and Care, and Time, and Trouble, and Money ſpent in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſatisfaction to his Luſt? What can he ſay he hath gotten, unleſs it be ſomewhat that he is afraid to own, or aſhamed to ſpeak of? For, as for that Pleaſure that is fancied, rather than found to be in carnal Enjoyments, it is in that caſe ſo very little, or rather none, as that it can in no ſort come in compariſon with all that Trouble and Charge that is undergone and ſpent for the obtaining of it. But then when with al it is conſidered, what inward Fears and Cares ſollicit the mind, whilſt the Fornicator is indulging thoſe outward Pleaſures to the Body, (what is the Amazement of Diſcovery, and what is the Terror that the Apprehenſion of it brings) the Fornicator's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, whereof he is ſo greedy, that he eats and ſurfeits to the deſtroying of Body and Soul, is but like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> how well-coloured and lovely ſoever without, nothing but Cinders and Aſhes within, utterly void of all real Pleaſure and Contentment. Such a fruitleſs Sin is this Sin of Fornication, ſo nothing at all of good comes on it; which alſo may be another preſſing Conſideration to diſſwade from the committing of it. And if that were all, that nothing of Good came of it, it were the leſs matter: but yet that is not all neither; for beſides that there comes no Good of it, there alſo comes a great deal of Miſchief and Evil of it. And, which is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our ſixth Conſideration, it is a miſchievous Sin.</hi> There comes a great deal of Miſchief from, and by it, as we ſhall ſhew in ſundry reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is miſchievous unto the <hi>Fornicator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is miſchievous unto <hi>Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, It is miſchievous unto the Fornicator himſelf; and that many ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cuts him out of the Favour of God, and brings him under his Diſpleaſure. <hi>God is angry</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 7.11.) <hi>with the wicked every day:</hi> and if ſo, then he is no day well-pleaſed with the Fornicator, who every day in the diſpoſition of his Heart, if not by the action of his Body, is offending God in a moſt contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious way. For he prefers that Delight which is taken in giving Satisfaction to the Luſts of his filthy and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62831:19"/>Members, before that Pleaſure which is had in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the holy and pure God. When the baſeſt Member about him requires the contrary to that which God commands, he chuſes rather to rebel againſt God, than not to give obedience to the Luſt of it; ſo in effect, chuſes that rather than God to be his Lord: Whereas he ſhould <hi>glorifie God in his Body</hi> (firſt <hi>created</hi> after the Image of God (according to the capacity of it) and then <hi>redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the Blood of God) by preferring ſo precious a Veſſel in Holineſs and Honour, he dſhonours God, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing his Body to be the Inſtrument of baſe Actions, and the Subject of baſe Enjoyments, ſubmitting it to bruitiſh lowneſs and vileneſs, and defiling it with naſty Pollution, and thereby provoking God to bring Deſtruction on him; for <hi>if any man defile the Temple of God,</hi> that is, his Body, <hi>him ſhall God deſtroy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.17. Noble Men think it a high Contumely and Reproach to them, when any of their Daughters prove guilty of this lewdneſs, or any of their Spouſes commit this filthineſs: Oh, how can God then but be inflamed with Anger, and burn with Jealouſie, when the Soul of Man, the Daughter of God, and the Spouſe of Chriſt, becomes guilty of this Harlotry, and gives her ſelf to his Uncleanneſs, as that of corporal Fornication is in the moſt literal Senſe of that Word. No marvel if <hi>God will judge Whoremongers and Adulterers;</hi> no marvel if he have provided a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone to waſh, or rather burn away the filthineſs of Fornicators.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it renders him odious to God, ſo it outs him of the Protection of Angels. God ſends forth his <hi>Angels to be ministring ſpirits to them who ſhall be heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14. And <hi>gives them charge over them to keep them in all their ways,</hi> Pſ. 91.11. But now the Fornicator, by acting that which diſinherits him of Salvation (for as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, nor effeminate Perſons, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God</hi>) he acts that by which he is diſintereſted in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Protection. And beſides, how can the Fornicator but be odious to the Angel that was deputed to the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip over him, when he immerſes and ſoaks himſelf into naſtineſs and filthineſs, ſo utterly contrary to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Nature and Purity. Angels are Beings of a pure and ſpiritual Nature, and the Fornicator ſwills himſelf in bodily filthineſs and uncleanneſs, ſo odious to the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62831:19"/>Fineneſs and Purity, that an Angel in Repreſentation (and to ſhew their deteſtableneſs of this Sin unto their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is (in the Lives of the Fathers) reported to have ſtopt his Noſe at the ſight of a Fornicator, as not able to endure the noiſom Savour and Stench of ſo polluted and unclean Perſon. And when once the good Angels of God have withdrawn from any man their Protection, who can we think but the evil Angels of Satan do take him into Poſſeſſion? Now this cannot but be thought a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to a man to be forſaken of his Defence, and inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Enemies; to be outed of the Protection of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and put into Subjection to Devils.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It dſpoſſeſſes him of the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit of God will not dwell but in a holy Temple: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Body of a Fornicator can be no Temple for him to inhabit; 'tis too naſty and filthy, polluted and defiled a place for him to abide in; 'tis a Sink of Uncleanneſs, and therefore can be no ſuitable Manſion for the Spirit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. For <hi>the Temple of God</hi> (that is, that Temple which God by his Spirit will dwell in) <hi>is holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.17. That Body which is defiled with Pollution of Luſt and Uncleanneſs, is no Temple of his, none that he will dwell in. Uncleanneſs chaſeth him out of his Habitation, outs him of his Temple, diſpoſſeſſes him of his Dwelling, which he will no longer abide in, than it continues to be holy. And therefore St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non polluas Templum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratum Domino, ne fias à Spiritu ejus alienum;</hi> take heed ye defile not that Temple of your Body which is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto the Lord, leſt thereby ye become a Stranger to his Spirit, <hi>i.e.</hi> leſt his Spirit be withdrawn from you, and forſake you. Our Church in her Morning Service ſuitably hereunto (as to me it ſeems) firſt prays that God would <hi>make clean our Hearts within us,</hi> and then <hi>not to take his Holy Spirit from us;</hi> intimating, that unleſs our Herarts be clean within us, God will not ſuffer his Holy Spirit to abide with us. What a Miſchief is this that the Fornicator doth himſelf? He deprives himſelf of the Preſence, of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, of the Comfort, of the Counſel of Gods Spirit, and hath no fellowſhip with the Holy Ghoſt. He tears off his Seal of Adoption, and throws away the Farneſt of eternal Salvation, and ſo hath now neither Right to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor Evidence for it. Yea, when the good Spirit is once departed out of its Habitation, the evil Spirit will he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62831:20"/>ready to enter into, and take it up for his own Poſſeſſion, and then the end of that Man is worſe than his beginning. Devils dwell in him now for a time, and he muſt dwell hereafter with Devils to all eternity in the World to come.</p>
            <p>And, which is conſequent to his, it disfurniſheth him of the Grace of God. For that which deprives a man of the Grace of the Spirit, muſt diveſt him of the Spirit of Grace. When the Spring is withdrawn, no wonder if the Streams dry up and fail. But beſides, Grace is a work of the Sprit, and Fornication (as all other Sins of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs are) is a Work of the Fleſh. Now <hi>the Fleſh and the Spirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>are contrary the one to the other.</hi> And therefere as the Principles of theſe Works, the Fleſh and the Spirit, are contrary each to other; ſo theſe Works which flow from theſe Principles, are contrary the one to the other. This (and ſo any) Sin of Uncleanneſs is not <hi>privatively</hi> only, but <hi>poſitively</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, even <hi>contrariantly</hi> oppoſite unto Grace; there is in it not only a want of Holineſs, but ſomething of poſitive filthineſs. Now as Logicians ſay, <hi>Contraria ſe mutuó de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruunt, alterumque alterius contractione remittitur;</hi> Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do deſtroy each other, and the preſence of the one is abated by the acceſs of the other. So that this Sin when it is admitted, diminiſhes and deſtroys Grace; the <hi>Act</hi> of it is a <hi>Diminution,</hi> and the <hi>Habit</hi> of it a <hi>Deſtruction</hi> to it. Now ſurely the Deſtruction of Grace in a man, is a great Miſchief to him; it is the defacing of his Evidence for, and a deſtroying of his Title to Heaven. For as the <hi>pure in heart ſhall ſee God,</hi> ſo <hi>without holineſs ſhall no man ſee the Lord,</hi> mat. 5.8. Heb. 12.14. It is the depriving him of every thing of Divine nature in him, and the ſtripping him of all, ſo much as likeneſs unto God. It is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>returning of him into a ſtate of corrupted nature, to a ſtate of Damnation, a Condition far worſe than that of Beaſts which periſh; which, whatever they ſuffer, yet they do not ſin, and find at once an end of their lives and of their miſeries; whereas the end of an ungracious mans life is but the beginning of an endleſs Death. yea further, it is the makingway for the Image and Nature of the Devil to enter upon, and overſpread the man; for as the Divine Nature and Image ſtands in Purity and Holineſs, ſo the Diabolical Image and Nature conſiſts in Impurity and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62831:20"/>So that, in effect, it is the making of a man, who was before the Child of God, to become the Child of the Devil. Whereupon St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays our Apoſtle did well to warn Chriſtians to flee Fornication, <hi>per quam filii Dei fiunt ſilii Diaboli;</hi> inaſmuch as by that, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God did become the Children of the Davil. A greater Miſchief is hard to ſay.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It wounds, and waſts, and deſtroys his Conſcience. This is a Sin that is done with Knowledge moſt an end, (for it is tare that a man ſhould be ſo far gone from himſelf through Drink, or any other Courſe, as that, like <hi>Lot,</hi> he ſhould not know hedoth commit the ſin when he doth commit it.) It is a Sin that requires much ſtudy in moſt Caſes, how to contrive and compaſs the commiſſion of it; and therefore, eſpecially in ſuch Caſes, is a Sin of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a Sin committed with deliberation, and therefore is a wilful Sin; and ſuch Sins are wounding Sins to the Soul, waſting Sins to the Conſcience; the firſt Act wounds, the ſecond waſts, and the Habit of it when it grows to that, quite deſtroys the Conſcience; the cuſtom of ſinning takes away all both Senſe and Conſcience of Sin; like thoſe Gentiles ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 4.17, 18, 19. <hi>who walked in the vanity of their mind, having their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that was in them, becauſe of the blindneſs,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>hardneſs of their heart, who being past feeling, gave themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> Which blindneſs and hardneſs, ſenſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupidity of Mind and Heart, when men once have through continued cuſtom of ſinning in this way, brought upon themſelves, then it is but juſt, that God ſhould <hi>give them up</hi> (in a Judicial way) <hi>unto Uncleanneſs,</hi> and unto <hi>vile Affections,</hi> and even <hi>give them over unto a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate mind,</hi> a mind void of Judgment, as he did thoſe <hi>Romas</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24, 26, 28. And this to be given over to a reprobate ſenſe, to have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cauterized, to be under a benummedneſs of mind, and a brawnineſs of heart, to be without Senſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſin, is to be under a moſt diſmal Judgment, the high Road to, and the very Gate into, and month of Hell. For when once a man is paſt ſeeling or ſin, he is the paſt ſorrowing for ſin, and paſt repenting of it, (without an extraordinary and miraculous Work of Conviction
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62831:21"/>wrought upon him) and without Repentance there can be no Salvation. And therefore that ſin which brings a man into this deſperate Condition, is a ſin that is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous with a Witneſs; it blinds the mind, perverts the judgment, benumbs the heart, ſears the Conſcience; leaving the mind under ſtupefaction and ſenſeleſneſs, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impenitency.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It diſtracts him in thoſe Duties to God, whereby he ſhould obtain the Grace of God, and preſerve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it when it is obtained. This fleſhly Luſt will not ſuffer him rightly to attend to any ſpiritual Duty: it will not ſuffer him to have any Communion with God, either by hearing God ſpeak to him in his Word, or ſpeaking to God himſelf in Prayer: it ſo takes up all his Thoughts, that he can mind nothing of the Worſhip and Service of of God as he ought. When he ſhould be thinking of God, he is thinking of his Whore; and inſtead of praying for Grace to abſtain from his ſin, and to mortifie his Luſt, he is plotting how to fulfil his Luſt, and commit his ſin. So true is that of St. <hi>Ambroſe, Nullus peccandi modus, &amp; inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexibilis ſcelerum ſitis, niſi morte amantis, extingui non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt;</hi> This ſin is unmeaſurable, unſatiable, the burning Thirſt whereof never quenched by any thing but Death. Now ſurely it is a very great miſchief to be ſo diſtracted in ones Duty to God; that is a plaguy Luſt that will not let a man be quiet till he hath ſaid his Prayers, but be as ill, or worſe a Tempter to a man than the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And yet ſuch a miſchievous ſin Luſt, is that whereby the Fornicator is ſwayed, and governed in his Courſe of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</p>
            <p>And no marvel: for it beſots and fools him, ſo that he neither minds, nor regards what he is about, unleſs it be when he is getting ſatisfaction to his Luſt. It diſpirits and unmans the man, and turns him all into Beaſt well nigh, ſaving what he is in ſhew and ſhape. Who could think any other that ſhould find <hi>Hercules,</hi> the only Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Wonder in his time for ſtrength and Valour, ſtooping to the meanneſs of being a Servant to <hi>Omphale,</hi> and in the quality of a Wench working at the Rock and Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? And what other can we think was meant by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets when they tell us of the ſtrange Transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and other Gods into a Bull, a Swan, and the like bruitiſh Creatures, for the love of, and to ſatisfie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62831:21"/>his luſt with this or that admired Beauty, but that luſt, this luſt of Fornication transforms and turns men, even the greateſt of them into very Beaſts, makes them do brutiſh things, as if they had no more of the Heart of a man in them, than <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had when he was turned to Graſs, than the Beaſts of the Field have. And this probably was meant by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> when in his fourth Chapter and cleventh Verſe, he makes Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be one of thoſe things that take away the Heart; <hi>Whoredom and wine, and new wine take away the Heart,</hi> do turn a man into a very beaſt. and ſuitably the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> compares theſe unclean ſinners to <hi>Horſes,</hi> luſtful Creatures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.8. <hi>They were as fed horſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>every one neighed after his Neighbours Wife.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe that <hi>walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, in the luſt of uncleanneſs,</hi> compares them to <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bruit beaſts made to be taken and deſtroyed;</hi> and even to <hi>Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Swine,</hi> two moſt unclean Creatures, and more irrational than any other Creatures in their luſts, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10, 12, 22.) which is a great miſchief to a man, as being the turning of him out of himſelf, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading of him into a Beaſt, rendring him unfit for any manly acting, and diſſolving him all into ſoftneſs and folly.</p>
            <p>And having bereft him of Judgment and Spirit, the leſs marvel is it, if it do alſo bereave him of his <hi>Freedom,</hi> and make a very <hi>Slave</hi> of him. It is an imperious luſt this; it makes them in whom it reigns, very Servants and Slaves to it. Hence theſe kind of people are by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſervants of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> adding this for the reaſon of his ſo calling them, becauſe that of <hi>whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought into bondage,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19. And ſo the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.16. <hi>Know ye not to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs?</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>v.</hi> 19. ſpeaks of their having <hi>yielded their members ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanos to uncleanneſs.</hi> So that this ſin of Uncleanneſs is a tyrannous luſt, it bereaves its Subjects of their Liberty and Freedom, and brings them under bondage and ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. A fornicator and a Free-man, are two terms that cannot be ſaid of the ſame Man: He that is a worker of Uncleanneſs is in a ſtate of very ſervitude; and a baſe, a wretched ſervitude is it that he ſerves. He is made a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62831:22"/>Servant to the moſt ſervile part of himſelf, his corrupt fleſh, and to the baſeſt part of his fleſh, the vileſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Body. And that is baſe that is inglorious, <hi>Nil vilius quam a carne vinci;</hi> to be conquered by, and enſlaved to the fleſh, is ſo vile and baſe, as nothing can be more. And yet what is much leſs vile and inglorious, he is a ſervant to a Woman, and muſt be ſubject to her pleaſures and diſpleaſures, frowned on, and talked to, yea to be boxed and knocked about the Ears with her Slipper, as of old they uſed to do, taking their Example from <hi>Omphales</hi> ſo uſing <hi>Hercules.</hi> Touching which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is that ſaying of the Roman Orator, <hi>Illum ego non liberum dico, cui mulier imperat, leges imponit;</hi> I cannot call him a free man, whom a Woman bears rule over, and gives Laws unto: ſo that if ſhe call, he muſt come; if ſhe bid be gone, he muſt away; if ſhe demand, he muſt give; if ſhe threaten, he muſt ſtand in awe. <hi>Hunc ergo non t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

Now, in as much as Freedom is a thing of high value, not only in the mind of any generous <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen, but in the mind of every true Chriſtian, who are redeemed from Slavery to Liberty by the Son of God himſelf; and that with the price of his own Blood, who became himſelf a Servant that they might be made Freemen, in ſo much is the bereaving a Man of his Freedom a pernicious miſchief; and the rather in that the loſs of his Freedom doth commence into a baſe and ſordid, cruel and intollerable, eaſeleſs and endleſs ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and drudgery, as that of this Luſt of Uncleanneſs is, which with the moſt mercileſs fury rages in, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizeth over the Fornicator, making a very Aſs, and Drudge, and Beaſt, and Slave of him. He would think ſo, and ſay ſo, that upon any other account were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubmit to thoſe meanneſſes, and act thoſe baſeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which at the command of this Luſt he humbles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the doing and enduring of: Enough this to affright any one from ever giving himſelf over to it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are divers Tempers of men, and ſome are perſwaded by one means, and ſome by another, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome other Conſiderations, which will ſhew it ſtill more and more miſchievous.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62831:22"/>
            <p> Sixthly therefore, It deprives a Man very much of his Quiet. I have ſhewed before how it keepeth him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually buſied, filling Head and Heart with thoughts and fears, and making him watch, and pray as I may ſay, and promiſe, and vow, attend and wait for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Luſt. But that's not all, it engages him in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious jangles and brawls, and quarrels, and ſtrifes, and fightings about the Whore with other Men. Either they would both have her, and quarrel and fight about that, or elſe one preferrs his Whore above the others, and then they quarrel and fight about that; or elſe ſome of her Relations are not able to endure ſuch abuſe to one of their Family, and then they quarrel and light about that. This St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> well obſerved, and thereupon concludes, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:) That if any Man love pleaſure, and would live his Life in quietneſs of mind, he muſt fly the converſe of Whores, for they fill the ſouls of their Lovers with infinite Wars and Troubles, and are continually putting them upon Fights and Contentions in all their words, in all their deeds. Who is able to reckon up, not the little brawls and brangles, quarrels and cuffings, but the moſt deſperate Weapon-fights in extemporary, or premeditated Duels, that have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe occaſions? The World hath ſeveral times been made but as it were one great Cock-pit, wherein Blood and Wounds, and Deaths have been dealt upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Luſt. The quarrel between <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Troy</hi> of old, which ended in the Deſtruction of that fair and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City, began in that. The War betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Saracens,</hi> which ended in the deſtruction of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the overrunning of much of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> with thoſe <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Enemies thereof, began alſo in that. So high ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flies the Contention betwixt Perſons engaged in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel upon the ſcore of this Luſt of Fornication, and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore by this it appears how miſchievous a ſin it is in this reſpect. He that devotes himſelf a Servant to that Miſtreſs, muſt expect as many real turmoils and Diſquiets, Brawls and Contentions, Duels and Fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, as our Romantick Writers fancy their Knights Errant at every turn to be engaged in for their airy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62831:23"/>Amours, and the imaginary Ladies of their Affections. But this is not all the Miſchief yet. For,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, It blaſts his <hi>Credit,</hi> ruines his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and deſtroys his <hi>Body.</hi> It blaſts his <hi>Credit,</hi> ſtains his <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and takes away his <hi>good Name.</hi> How ſhameful a ſin this is in all the Circumſtances of it, is already ſhown. Now what but Shame and Diſgrace can be the Fruit of ſo ſhameful a Root? Whereupon no doubt it is, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> counſels his Son to <hi>remove his way from her, and come not nigh the door, leſt he ſhould give his honour unto others;</hi> that is, run himſelf into Shame and Diſgrace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8, 9. The Names by which Perſons addicted to this Vice, are ſpoken of, and mentioned, carry the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Perſon along with them in the Front there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Such in theſe our days of looſeneſs and laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the name of <hi>Gallant,</hi> not to name the more groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhameful Names of <hi>Whoremaſter</hi> and <hi>Wheremongers,</hi> and the like. Perſons of modeſty know not well how to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, but with ſome brand of Infamy affixed to their Names. How are their Crimes made the talk of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! And that which they think they act in ſecret, not whiſpered, but openly ſpoken of in the Houſe-top. How are their Miſcarriages, Diſcoveries, Quarrels, made the Subject of common Diſcourſe! And, if upon Conviction they be brought to undergo that Shame which the Law inflicts upon ſuch ſhameleſs Offenders, there needs no more be added to ſo publick a Diſgrace. And ſure the taking away of a man's good Name, the ſpoiling of his Credit, the ſoiling of his Reputation, is a great Miſchief; elſe there would not be ſo many Suits and Quarrels as there happens every day about Reputation and point of Honour. It hath been uſed to be ſaid, <hi>Actum eſt de homine, ſi actum eſt de nomine;</hi> A man had as good be half hanged, as, in an ill Name. And no doubt but it is a great hinderance to many a ones riſe to Preferment, that he is in an ill Name for this Vice: For what Perſon of Quality or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will come within the Embraces of thoſe Arms that are uſed to hug a Whore? Or what credit can ſhe give to the Promiſes and Vows, Proteſtations and Oaths of that Tongue that is uſed to make the like Courtſhip to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Strumpet?</p>
            <p>But it does not only ſtab and wound a man's Honour and Reputation, but alſo <hi>ruines</hi> his Estate. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62831:23"/>in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29 3. <hi>He that keepeth company with Harlots; ſpendeth his ſubstance.</hi> And in <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.26. That <hi>by means of a whoriſh Woman a man is brought to a piece of bread.</hi> And in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.10. he exhorts to avoid keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Company with a ſtrange Woman, that is, an Whoſe or Harlot, leſt <hi>ſtrangers be filled with thy Wealth, and thy labours be in the houſe of the Stranger;</hi> that is, leſt thou ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine thy Eſtate, and bring thy ſelf to Poverty thereby, whilſt others in the mean time run away with thy Eſtate. A Proof whereof we have in the Prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. <hi>who having gathered all his Subſtance together, took his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into a far Country, and there waſted his Subſtance with riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous living,</hi> v. 13. that is, he ſpent all upon Whores. Whence it is, that in <hi>v.</hi> 30. his elder Brother tells his Father, that his Son had <hi>devoured his living,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with Harlots,</hi> or Whores. And if we had not this Inſtance, we have deplorable Example enough in our Times and Countries, every day almoſt, before our Eyes: But of this we made mention before in our Diſcourſe upon the Expenſiveneſs of this ſin, and therefore ſhall not here much enlarge thereon; only we ſhall note, that beſides all thoſe ways of Expence, whereon we touched before, as the <hi>Hire</hi> of Whores, and the <hi>Treatments</hi> of them, <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Preſents</hi> to them, and <hi>Bribes</hi> to thoſe about them, <hi>Expence</hi> in Diet and Drink, Phyſick or Fees, even that careleſneſs of ones own Eſtate and Affairs, which the following of this ſin cauſes and occaſions, is enough and enough again to ruin and undo one. When the Maſter attends not to his own Concerns, but leaves all at ſixes and ſevens, and is abroad day by day, and night by night, perhaps Week by Week, following his pleaſure of Whore-hunting; beſides that few will regard to preſerve his Eſtate, there will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now ready to counſel, and forward to help on that which will tend to his undoing. Now to be ruined and undone, to be brought from Wealth to Want, from Plenty to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, is a miſery ſo great in it ſelf, (and yet ſo much greater, in that the Wickedneſs by which it is procured, renders a man no Object of Pity, whilſt he is in miſery) that the ſin that brings all this upon a man, may well be ſaid to be a miſchievous ſin, it is ſo ruinous, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62831:24"/>
            <p> But which is more, it deſtroys his <hi>Body</hi> too, it weakens his Strength, impairs his Health, ſhortens his Life, and haſtens his Death. How many are ſuddenly cut off in the midſt of their days, and in the ſtrength of their years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed in Dueis, or other Quarrels about Whores, or in Suppritals with them, as <hi>Pope John</hi> the Thirteenth was by the Husband of a Woman, with whom he was found by him in the Act of Adultery; and as <hi>Zimri</hi> was, being taken by <hi>Phineas</hi> in the Act of Fornication with <hi>Cozbi,</hi> (Numb. 25.8.) or by cloſe Stratagems by them or others, as <hi>Pope John</hi> the Eleventh was ſtiffed with a Pillow by his Strumpet <hi>Marozia,</hi> that her Son might obtain the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In reference to which, that of <hi>Solomon</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be ſpoken, when he tells us of a young Man void of Underſtanding, whom <hi>a Harlot with much fair ſpeeches, cauſed to yield to her, and forced with the flattering of her Lips; and of whom he ſaith, he goeth after her ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as an Ox to the ſlaughter, or as a Fool to the correction of the Stocks: Till a dart strike through his Liver, as a Bird, he haſteth to the Snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life,</hi> Prov. 7.6, to 24. And of thoſe that eſcape ſuch ſudden Death, yet how many are brought by their filthy doings to filthy Diſeaſes, ſhameful to name, loathſom to behold, tormenting to endure, deadly, if not cured in time, and both troubleſom and chargeable to be cured (if a Cure be got) ſo they rot alive, and ſtink above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground; and if they die not upon Dung-hills (as ſome have done) yet whilſt they live, they are but as Dung upon the Earth. For, beſides the Infection which they are apt to take from the diſeaſed, pocky Bodies of Whores, even their own Laſciviouſneſs and immoderate uſe of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery is apt to waſt their Spirits, and dry up their radical moiſture, and extinguiſh natural heat, whereby they are brought to Conſumptive Diſeaſes, which wear them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to untimely Deaths. And the fear of ſomething of this nature<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Patrick'</hi> Paraph. upon the place.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> thought fit to interpoſe as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſſwade from this ſin, when he counſels, to avoid the Company of an Harlot, <hi>leſt thou mourn at the laſt, when thy fleſh and thy body are conſumed,</hi> Prov. 5.12. And by which deſtroying it, as well as defiling it, the Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62831:24"/>ſins againſt his own Body, as our Apoſtle may well be thought to mean in the latter end of the Text, the Argument by which he ſtrengtheneth his Exhortation in the beginning of it, to <hi>flee Fornication.</hi> Now certainly that which brings upon a man ſo much evil, as in the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Diſeaſes, or ſudden Deaths of Fornication, who, if not killed by others, which is ill, yet are generally kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by themſelves, which is worſe, that muſt needs be judged by every rational perſon to be a very miſchievous thing: No man ſure will ever follow it, that hath not a mind to ruine and deſtroy his own Body, to ſhorten the time of his own Life, and procure and haſten on his own Death. But this is not all the Miſchief it doth: For,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, It turns him out of the <hi>Church Militant and Triumphant.</hi> Firſt, It turns the Fornicator out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt <hi>on Earth.</hi> A Fornicator is ſuch as Chriſt will not have to be a Member of ſo much as his outward viſible Church; he will not have ſuch a Perſon to have any external Communion with him, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him; he allows not thoſe that are his Members ſo much as to have Civil Converſe with them, if after their having given up their Names to Chriſt, they ſhall addict themſelves to this heartheniſh Sin. And therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.9, 11. wrote unto the <hi>Corinthians not to keep company with Fornicators; and if any man that is called a Brother, ſhould be a Fornicator, with ſuch a one no not to eat;</hi> that is, to have no, either ſacred, or ſo much as civil Converſe withal.<note n="*" place="bottom">D. Ambroſ. in loc.</note> 
               <hi>Cum fratre in quo hoc vitia reperiuntur, non ſacramenta edenda, ſed ne communem eſcam docet, ut eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcat cum vitiatur, &amp; ſe corrigat.</hi> And in all the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (in that Viſion which St. <hi>John</hi> had of the Church of Chriſt under that notion, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 21, &amp; 22.) or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation) the Evangeliſt could not eſpy one Fornicator. They were with Companions like themſelves, <hi>Dogs, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, Murderers,</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> in another place <hi>without</hi> that City, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15.) that being a place into which there was not <hi>in any wiſe to enter any thing that defileth,</hi> (Rev. 21.27.) And Fornication is one of the things that our Saviour declareth to be defiling things, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19, 20.) and ſo there is no coming for ſuch Perſons to,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62831:25"/>nor continuing of ſuch Perſons in that Place. Now cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be cut off from Communion with the Church of Chriſt, is a miſchief great in it ſelf, whatever thought of by profane Worldlings: For they upon whom the Churches Cenſure falls in that kind and meaſure, are excluded from the Benefit of the Churches Ordinances, the Word and Sacraments, the Food of their Souls; they are excluded from communicating with the Churches Prayers, and having any ſhare in the Bleſſings ſought and obtained by thoſe Prayers; they are excluded from inward Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt, outed of all relation as Members unto him, and ſo are deprived of the influence of his Spirit into them: In a word, they are delivered up unto Satan, and their Sins ſo bound on Earth, that they are bound alſo in Heaven, not to be looſed either here or there, without Repentance, and a Deſire at leaſt, and Endeavour to have Abſolution: Which Miſchief was ſo dreaded by Offenders in the primitive Times, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not to be re-admitted into the Communion again, they would continue in the ſtate of Pennance, and do the Pennance of Offenders a long time, many years, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Church-door, and lying proſtrate on the ground, with Prayers and Tears beſeeching and begging the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thoſe that went into the Church. And beſides all this, I might add, that even upon Perſons that continue obſtinate Deſpiſers of this Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, and will not be reduced to obedience, and brought to Reformation by this Chaſtiſement; the Civil Law hath uſed to fall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavily in Fines and Impriſonments, or both. But without and beſides this, the Church's Cenſure or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, even allow it, and of it ſelf, is enough to make any afraid of doing any thing whereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and incurr it, to abſtain from, and flee Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, for it not only ejects out of the Church of Chriſt, but alſo excludes out of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> What earthly Poſſeſſions ſoever the Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator hath on Earth, he is never like to have any Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Heaven. <hi>For this ye know</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> 5.5.) <hi>no Whoremonger hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">D. Ambroſ. in loc.</note> 
               <hi>Qui talis fuerit, partem

And he ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> c. 6. v. 9, 10. <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Adulterers ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And ſo again to the <hi>Galatians, They who do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> and Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one of theſe things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 19, 20. Now if the Puniſhment of <hi>Loſs</hi> be greater than the Puniſhment of <hi>Senſe,</hi> as Caſuiſts conclude, then inaſmuch as the loſs of Heaven, is the loſs of the greateſt Good, that which brings upon a man that loſs, does him the greateſt miſchief that poſſibly can be done. O, who is able to imagine what miſchief it is to be ſhut out of Heaven! It imports to be ſhut out from the Enjoyment of the greateſt Good that can be deſired or imagined; from Society with God, and Chriſt, and Angels, and Saints; from all thoſe Joys and Pleaſures, Delights and Felicities wherewith the Souls of emparadiſed Perſons are bathed, and bliſſed, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and raviſhed, even into Extaſies of moſt delightful Admiration. Now this may be a weighty Conſideration to induce the Fornicator, if he hath any regard in the leaſt to his own Souls eternal Good, to abſtain from that Wickedneſs, by the commiſſion whereof, he ſhall forfeit and loſe ſo great a Happineſs.</p>
            <p>But this is not the height of this ſins miſchief, for it not only debarrs from Heaven, but it <hi>damns to Hell,</hi> plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Fornicator into that Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, which burneth to Eternity. So our Apoſtle in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Whoremongers, Sorcerers, Idolaters, Lyars, ſhall have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> So deep, it ſeems, is the ſilth of this ſin, that nothing elſe but Floods of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone can waſh it out, and nothing leſs than Eternity can be time enough, even for that to waſh it out in. Now when to the miſchief of <hi>Heavens loſs,</hi> is added the miſchief of <hi>Hells Pain;</hi> there is nothing, that I know, that can be added to make it more miſchievous: And yet ſuch is this ſin of Fornication to the Fornicator, it debars him from Heaven, it damns him to Hell; it ſends him to thoſe Regions where is Darkneſs without light, Torment without eaſe, Sorrow without end; where his Bed he muſt lie down on, ſhall be a fiery Pile of unconſumable Fuel; and the Sheets wherewith he muſt be inwrapped,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62831:26"/>ſhall be ſcorching Flames of that inextinguiſhable Fire. The Conſideration of this tremendous Cataſtrophe of the Fornicator's play, this dreadful Puniſhment which he is like to be condemned to, ſhould (as any reaſonable man would think) be enough, if any thing can be enough to work with him, and perſwade him to <hi>abstain from</hi> the commiſſion of ſo miſchievous a ſin, and to <hi>flee Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet is not this neither all the Miſchief that it doth; for hitherto we have ſpoken only of the Miſchief that it doth to the <hi>Fornicator himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is ſtill a Miſchief that it doth to <hi>Others</hi> beſides himſelf. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is miſchievous to the Woman with whom the ſin is committed. For, firſt, it involves her in the <hi>ſame Guilt of ſin</hi> with the Fornicator. It is not his Temptation that will acquit her from the Guilt of ſo ſinful a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: To be tempted, is no ſin; but to yield to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, to conſent to the Tempter, to act the thing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to, that is ſinful. And indeed the Law of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay not againſt the Man only, but againſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alſo; for it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.17. <hi>There ſhall be no Whore of the Daughters of the Children of Iſrael.</hi> The Fornicator therefore cannot commit this ſin alone, but he muſt draw ſin by that Act upon another too, as well as upon himſelf, and ſo aggravate ſtill his own more, as not having only ſinned himſelf, but made another ſin too, by conſenting to, and acting that filthineſs with him; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as there ought to be no <hi>conſenting</hi> unto the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement of Sinners unto Wickedneſs, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10.) no partaking with Adulterers, (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 50.18.) no having fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the unfruitful Works of darkneſs, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11.) And the Woman that hath to do with ſuch Perſons in ſuch Actions, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Sinner,</hi> a Perſon eminently, and highly ſinful, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37. And how can ſhe but be a great Sinner, who is an Actor in that which in the Scripture is called a great Wickedneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9.</p>
            <p>And after this ſin committed, it brings upon her <hi>Shame;</hi> if a <hi>Maid,</hi> it robs her of her <hi>Glory,</hi> which was her <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity;</hi> if a <hi>Widow,</hi> it robs her of her <hi>Honour,</hi> which was her <hi>Integrity.</hi> In <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.29. it is ſaid, <hi>Do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute thy Daughter, to cauſe her to be a Whore.</hi> What in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62831:26"/>Text is read <hi>proſtitute,</hi> in the Margent is <hi>profane.</hi> So <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.17. the Prieſt was not to take a Wife that was a Whore, or profane; ſo alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 9. ſo that to be a Whore, is to be a profane Woman, her Whoredom is a Profanation to her. When <hi>Tamar</hi> had a mind to deceive her Father-in-law, <hi>ſhe covered her ſelf with a vail, and wrapped her ſelf, and ſate in an open place. And when Judah ſaw her, he thought her to be an Harlot, becauſe ſhe had covered her face,</hi> Gen. 38.14, 15. The thing (as it would ſeem by this) was in thoſe days ſo ſhameful, that ſhe that acted it, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſhow her face when ſhe did it, both before, and after the doing of it. In our Laws the ſhame of the Fact lights on the Woman as well as the Man, who is to be a publick Spectacle to all Beholders, whether in Church or Market, as well as the Man. The very Name of a Whore, which ſhe gets unto her ſelf thereby, hath ſo much of Shamefulneſs and Reproach, Diſhonour and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace in it, as nothing can have more. No greater filth can be thrown upon any, than what is comprehended in that Name; worſe cannot well be ſaid of a Woman, than that ſhe is a Whore; 'tis all Shame in one Word: And therefore miſchief abundance he doth to a Woman that brings her under that Shame.</p>
            <p>And which is conſequent to her Shame, it brings upon her <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> (or if you will, other Puniſhment beſides the Shame.) If the Daughter of any Prieſt <hi>profaned her ſelf by playing the whore,</hi> ſhe was to be <hi>burned with Fire,</hi> Lev. 21.9. If the Daughter of any other perſon did it, ſhe was to be <hi>ſtoned</hi> to death. Thus runs the Law in that Caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.21. <hi>They ſhall bring out the Damoſel to the door of her Fathers houſe, and the men of the City ſhall ſtone her with Stones, that ſhe die, becauſe ſhe hath wrought folly in Iſrael, to play the whore in her Fathers houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Adultereſs as well as the Adulterer, was ſurely to be put to death,</hi> Lev. 20.10. If a Bond-maid were found guilty in this Caſe, tho ſhe was not to be put to death, <hi>becauſe ſhe was not free, yet ſhe was to be ſcourged,</hi> Lev. 19.20. So ſharp Puniſhment was the female Offender in this kind to undergo by the Law; and there is no exemption from Puniſhment for them in the Goſpel: but Fornicators of what Sex ſoever, are to be thrown out of the Church, to be ſhut out of Heaven, and to be turned into Hell, as we have already ſhown in the former part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62831:27"/>This ſin is as miſchievous to the Woman with whom it is committed, as well as to the Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is miſchievous to the Child that is (if any be) got by ſuch ſinful Copulation. The Schoolmen make this ſin of Fornication, ſimple Fornication, to be a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin; and that in ſuch meaſure, that <note n="*" place="bottom">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> ſol. <hi>11.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Peraldus,</hi> a Papiſt, concludes, That if one who had never before ſinned in Thought, Word, or Deed, but had done all the good that could be imagined, ſhould once, and but once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this ſin, <hi>ex neceſſitate damnabitur,</hi> he muſt of neceſſity be damned, if he die without Repentance: Inſomuch that if all the Maſſes that ever ſhall be ſaid by the Church to the Worlds end, ſhould be ſaid for him, <hi>non liberarent eum à morte eternâ,</hi> they could not deliver him from eternal Death; which they may do well (by the way) to take notice of, that make ſo light a matter of this deadly ſin, as is commonly made of it.</p>
            <p>Now if we enquire into the ground of the deadlineſs of this ſin, we ſhall find it placed by them in the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of it to the Children of Fornication.<note n="‖" place="bottom">

                  </gap>thale crimen:</hi> This is the Concluſion of <hi>Aquinas</hi> in the Caſe; Simple Fornication, inaſmuch as it is againſt the good of the Off-ſpring to be brought forth, is ſo unlawful, as that it is a deadly ſin. There is not that care ordinarily in Fornicators for the preſerving, and providing for their Children begotten in, and born of Fornication, that Nature obliges all Parents to take, and have of their Off-ſpring, and then doth this ſin become unto the Committers of it, a deadly ſin.</p>
            <p>And to look a little nearlier into this buſineſs, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children ſo begotten, are by one means or other ſtifled in their Mother's Womb, and murdered before they are born, or expelled thence before the time to bring forth, and ſo killed in their very Birth!</p>
            <p>Again, How many of them (to hide the Infamy and Shame of their Birth) are by the Hands of the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them, ſtrangled, or drowned, or otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed as ſoon as they are born! We need not go ſo far for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62831:27"/>inſtance as to the Popes Ponds, out of which ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand murdered Infants Skulls were taken. How ſeldom is there an Aſſize with us, wherein there are not ſome or other arraigned for ſuch Facts as theſe, the Murthers of Baſtards!</p>
            <p>Again, how many of them are, if not at firſt violently ſtrangled to death, yet afterwards leiſurely ſtarved to death, and quite loſt for want of looking after! Tho ſome do, yet not very many of them live to be Men and Women. The Mother is aſhamed of it, and tho ſhe hath not a Heart out-right to kill it, or hath no mind to be hanged for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, yet wiſhes it dead, and is wanting in afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it means of Health and Life. And the Father, as not being certain that it is his, (for ſhe that is falſe with one, may be ſo with another; and ſo none that hath to do with her, can be aſſured that it is his more than anothers) he hath no affection for it, takes little or no care for the Maintenance and Education of it, and ſo it ſeldom thrives and comes to good.</p>
            <p>The ſight of it is the remembrance of its Parents ſin, and a renewal of the ſhame, and therefore they ordinarily have neither that love to it, nor care of it that Parents have, or ought to have to, and for the Fruit of their Bodies; ſo that wanting the Effects of that Love and Care, it commonly dwindles away until it die.</p>
            <p>Yet again, if it live, it becomes incapable of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, until it be legitimated by Act of Parliament, and ſo is diſinherited before it be born.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, What care ſoever be taken for it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in Life, and provide it of Eſtate (for not all are ſo wicked, as to be ſo cruel to, or careleſs of it) yet the baſeneſs of its Birth is ſuch a Blot to its Name, ſuch a ſtain to its Honour, ſuch a Diſgrace to its Perſon, as it is never able to wipe off. It is diſgracefully ſpoken of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion; and eſpecially in any Quarrel ſhall be ſure to hear it ſelf called by the uſual ignominious Names. The bye Blows even of Kings and Princes ſeldom have their Names in Chronicles tranſmitted to Poſterity, but with a Brand of the Infamy of their Birth ſet upon them, being remembred as the <hi>baſe Sons</hi> of ſuch or ſuch a Prince. So miſchievous in point of Life, Eſtate, and Honour, is this Sin of Fornication to the Child of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is miſchievous unto <hi>Religion:</hi> It brings a Scandal upon Chriſtianity, as if that were a Religion that either taught, or at leaſt, did tolerate Fornication. And of thoſe that follow that ſin, may that of <hi>Salvian</hi> truly be ſaid (<hi>de Gub. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Per flagitia ac turpitudines ſuas, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Religionis infamant;</hi> By their Wickedneſſes and Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes they defame the Name of Religion. For what would a Civil Heathen, <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi> ſay other, but that the Religion it ſelf could not be good, whoſe Profeſſors they ſaw to be ſo bad. <hi>Si enim bona diſcerent, boni eſſent;</hi> For did they learn that which was good, they themſelves could not but be good. <hi>Talis proſecto Secta eſt, quales &amp; Sectatores;</hi> Such verily is the way they follow, as the Followers of that way are. <hi>Hoc ſunt abſque dubio quod docentur;</hi> That undoubtedly they are, which they are taught to be. It appears therefore that their Prophets which they have, do teach them filthineſs; That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles which they read, do teach them uncleanneſs; and that the Goſpels wherein they are inſtructed, do preach thoſe things which themſelves do practiſe. Thus do our Fornicators cauſe <hi>the way of Truth to be ill-ſpoken of,</hi> and <hi>that Doctrine which is according unto Godlineſs,</hi> to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an Inſtruction unto Filthineſs; than which no greater Miſchief can be done to Religion, no fouler Scandal can be brought on Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>And as it is miſchievous unto Religion, ſo in the next place alſo unto the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> for it brings a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal upon that, makes that be ill-thought of, and ill-ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of too: We may give an Inſtance in the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks of old; theſe wretched Miſcreants taught all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of filthineſs of Manners, made Wickedneſs to be a Religion. Theſe Practices of theirs gave great occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord (both the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and infidel Heathens) to blaſpheme. Their beaſtly Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices were laid to the charge of the Orthodox Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were all judged ſuch as they were. And the like befell the Church again from the Debaucheries of the <hi>Carpocratians,</hi> who, as<note n="*" place="bottom">Contra Hereſ. Carpocrat. l. <hi>1.</hi> To. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to the Reproach and Scandal of the Church of God.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62831:28"/>
            <p> Their filthy Actings brought a baſe Report on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, as if they were all ſuch as thoſe Hereticks were, none among them better than they. And truly when the Whoredoms, with the other Wickedneſſes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> are known (as known they are) to <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and Pagans, what can they think, but that the Church of Chriſt is a wicked Company of Reprobates, rather than any holy Communities of Saints; and out of deteſtation of their viciouſneſs, abſtain from joyning with them in their Communion; as if it were as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful now for Infidels to joyn with Believers, as formerly it was for Believers to have fellowſhip with Infidels.</p>
            <p>Thus it is miſchievous to the Catholick Church, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Infidels and Unbelievers abroad.</p>
            <p>And to this particular Church it is no leſs miſchievous in reſpect of Separatiſts and Schiſmaticks at home.</p>
            <p>For that (eſpecially when ſo many) Members of our Church do act ſuch filthineſs, gives them occaſion to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hardly of us, as if we were a Company of carnal Creatures, had none of the Spirit of Chriſt abiding in us, and were not true Members (and ſo no true Church) of Chriſt, and thereupon to ſtand off from our Communion, and rather live and die in Separation from us, than return to Union with us; and eſpecially when they ſee ſuch Wickedneſs tolerated among us, or at leaſt connived at by us, ſo that the Actors of it paſs uncenſured and unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for what they do, being admitted not only into Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Commerce with us in worldly matters, but unto ſacred Communion with us in heavenly Ordinances, the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer. The ſerious Conſideration of this, were enough to make a pious Heart not weep, but even bleed again with Grieſ. O, the heavy Reproach that lies upon this Church upon this account! O, the ſad miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that is brought upon it by this means!</p>
            <p>And even the Remedy of this, if the Church ſhall go about in earneſt to remedy it, will not be without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Church: For, O how many, O how great Perſons muſt be cut off from the Church for this thing! Of whoſe returning after ſuch Excommunication, the Church could have but little hope; and for whoſe not returning after it, it could not but have great Sorrow. And thus the Church of Chriſt, both the Catholick throughout all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Particular with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62831:29"/>this Kingdom, ſuffer by this Sin of Fornication.</p>
            <p>Neither does it end here, but laſtly, it is alſo miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>the Perſons in it,</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> upon it. Firſt, it defiles the Perſons that are in it. Among <hi>the things that defile a man, Fornication</hi> is reckoned up for one, <hi>Marth.</hi> 15.18. and accordingly <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> and <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> go together in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. And ſo <hi>Whoremonger</hi> and <hi>unclean Perſon,</hi> Eph. 5.5. It defiles the Perſon that acts this Uncleanneſs by that Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that flows from it unto their own perſons; for upon the commiſſion of this alſo, as of every other ſin, the Actor doth not only become a guilty perſon, but alſo a filthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; filthy in the ſight of God's Eye, as well as guilty of the breach of God's Law; ſuch a Perſon God hates to ſee, as well as is reſolved to judge.</p>
            <p>And it defiles the Perſons of others that converſe with them, by the Contagion that it ſpreads by their filthy Converſations, and Examples, into the Lives and Manners of others; one ſcabbed Sheep, as it is ſaid by way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, deriving Infection into the whole Flock. O, 'tis a moſt infectious Vice this! the converſe of Fornicators is contagious, their very Breath is peſtilential, their evil Word but too to powerful to corrupt other mens good manners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It brings <hi>Deſtruction upon it.</hi> For when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are defiled upon the Land, <hi>then is the Earth defiled under the Inhabitants thereof,</hi> (Iſ. 24.5.) and that's a time both for God to viſit upon the Inhabitants their Iniquity, and for the Earth alſo, becauſe of their Iniquity, to vomit and ſpue out the Inhabitants, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.25, 28.</p>
            <p>A ſmart inſtance there is of Gods Wrath againſt a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this ſin, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.1, <hi>&amp;c. Iſrael began to commit Whoredom with the Daughters of Moab, and they called the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto the Sacrifices of their Gods,</hi> (wherein all filthineſs and lewdneſs was committed, and even as a part of the Religion;) and thereupon <hi>all the Heads of the people</hi> are commanded to be taken and hanged up before the Lord by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the Judges of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are commanded <hi>to ſlay every one his men that were joyned to Baal-peor;</hi> ſo that there were form and twenty thouſand that died of that Plague, which beake in upon them upon that occaſion, which was ſtayed by the Execution of <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> ſlain by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> in his Zeal, thruſting him and her thorough the Belly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62831:29"/>with his Javelin, as they lay together in the Tent. Oh, 'tis a Nation ruining, a Land deſtroying (becauſe a Land defiling) ſin, this ſin of Fornication. And no doubt but the many Judgments that have been long and heavy upon us, whereby we have been brought to great deſolation, and even to the brink of the Pit of utter Deſtruction, have faln upon us, in a very great meaſure, for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent beaſtly ſin of Fornication, which hath ſpread it ſelf throughout the whole Land, ſo that there is ſcarce a a Town in the Kingdom that hath not been more or leſs defiled with it: And, oh, not how many only, but how great Perſons alſo are notoriouſly known to be guilty of it! who make that to be their Glory, which ſhould be their Shame, ſinning like <hi>Abſolom</hi> on the top of the Houſe, and in the ſight of the Sun, with a Face of Braſs, and Heart of Flint, being neither ſorry for it, nor aſhamed of it: God in mercy in his due time convince them of it, and convert them from it.</p>
            <p>By this now, it appears how miſchievous this ſin, even of ſimple Fornication is, even unto <hi>others</hi> alſo, beſides the Fornicator himſelf.</p>
            <p>But now where the Fornication is not ſimple, but is committed with Perſons that live in Wedlock, there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all the miſchiefs, and thoſe in a higher meaſure and degree (as the ſin is in a higher meaſure and degree more ſinful) there are other Miſchiefs alſo that come thereby. O, the vexation of that Man or Woman, who is poſſeſſed with the Spirit of<note n="*" place="bottom">They that would ſee the terrible effects of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> let them read St. <hi>Chryſoftom.</hi>

               </note> Jealouſie upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions! What Brawls! what Quarrels! what fightings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Man and Wife, and betwixt Neighbour and Neighbour, and betwixt Rival and Rival, are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned hereby! Yea, how much ſin is this many times the occaſion of! what lying, and ſwearing, and curſing, and railing, is there about it! Here one hangs himſelf for grief at his Wive's Diſloyalty; there another poyſons her Husband, or drowns her ſelf, out of rage for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Diſhoneſty. Here a Husband turns Whoremaſter to cry quit with his Wife; and there a Wife turns Whore to cry quit with her Husband; I know not whether more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62831:30"/>fooliſhly, or more wickedly, chuſing rather to hazard the Damnation of their own Souls, than not to be revenged on the other for their unfaithfulneſs with their Bodies. It were ſmall to ſay how ready a way this makes, and what a wide Sluce it opens for the Eſtate and Livelihood to run out at, and for Ruine and Deſtruction to run in; Grace and Glory, Heaven and Happineſs are forfeited by it; Sin and Miſery, Hell and Damnation are incurred through it.</p>
            <p>Now when unto the <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Shamefulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs,</hi> and <hi>Expenſiveneſs</hi> of this ſin, there is yet further added this Conſideration of the great <hi>Miſchievouſneſs</hi> of it, and that ſo many ways, not only to the <hi>Fornicator himſelf,</hi> but to the <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> of Fornication; yea, to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> both the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> throughout the World, and this <hi>Particular</hi> within this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and even to the whole Nation and <hi>Kingdom it ſelf;</hi> what can be ſaid? what can be thought, that may be added to beget in a man a greater Deteſtation of this ſin, and ſtronglier incline him to obey this Command of God given by his Apoſtle in the Text, which is to <hi>flee Fornication:</hi> God bleſs what hath hitherto been done, that it may be effectual to that, in thoſe that ſhall read it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have diſpatched the third thing deſigned by me to be done upon this Point, which was to give you ſome Conſiderations by way of Motive to preſs on to the flying of this Sin.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I ſhall now proceed to the fourth and laſt thing, which is, <hi>To give you ſome Directions for the flying of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I begin with my Directions, it may not be amiſs by the way to conſider, whether that which the Directions tend to, the flying of Fornication, be a thing feaſible, that it may be done or no; if it be a thing that a man may fly, then it may be to purpoſe to give Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the flying of it. But if it be a thing that a man cannot fly, then all the Directions that can be given, will be in vain, and it will be but loſt-labour to ſpeak of them. And it is no needleſs Inquiry this, becauſe there are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſeek to juſtifie their Commiſſion of this ſin, by the impoſſibility of their abſtaining from its Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:62831:30"/>
            <p> Now in the firſt place, I cannot underſtand why our Apoſtle ſhould enjoyn the <hi>Corinthians</hi> here to <hi>flee Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> if it were a thing a man cannot flee. Doth the Spirit of God give any unneceſſary Preſcriptions? or Chriſt impoſe any impoſſible Injunctions? How then is Chriſt's <hi>yoke eaſie, and his burden light?</hi> Yea, how are his Commandments any other but grievous? What chuſing can there be to keep, or not keep an impoſſible Precept? And what ſin can there be in the <hi>Act,</hi> where there is no choice in the <hi>Will? Nemo peccat in eo quod vitare non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt;</hi> No man ſins in doing that which he cannot poſſibly but do, if we believe St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ttrue, by the meer ſtrength of our own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, we can neither keep this, nor any other Precept of Gods; for <hi>without me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15.5.) <hi>ye can do nothing: Neither</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>are we ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> Yet by the ſufficiency which we have from God, we may be enabled to keep this, or any other Precept: Tho our Free-will be not, yet <hi>his grace is ſufficient for us,</hi> to enable us thereto. <hi>If he work in us to will and to do of his good pleaſure, then thro his good pleaſure we can both will and do.</hi> Then ſaith St. <hi>Paid, I can do all things thro Chriſt, which ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. And as God cannot be overcome of evil, ſo neither will he ſuffer us to be <hi>tempted above what we are able,</hi> if we ſeek to him for ſtrength, <hi>but will with the temptation make way to eſcape,</hi> that we may be able to bear it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Thence our Saviour taught its to pray, not to be <hi>led into</hi> (that is, not to be left to our ſelves in, and overcome by any) <hi>Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let us a little conſider whence it is that our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, who complains of his Unableneſs to contain, is enforced and conſtrained to this ſin? Is it from <hi>God,</hi> or from the <hi>Devil,</hi> or from the <hi>Woman,</hi> or from his own <hi>fleſh?</hi> From <hi>God</hi> it cannot be, for he only permits it, he doth not neceſſitate to it by any Impulſe or Decree of his. From the <hi>Devil</hi> it cannot be, for he commonly tempts, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enforce to ſin. From the <hi>Woman</hi> it cannot be, for ſhe can only allure, ſhe cannot compel. (Not to ſay that the greateſt Complainers, that they cannot forbear this ſin, are the greateſt Tempters of Women to it.) And from his own <hi>Fleſh</hi> it cannot be, becauſe that may diſpoſe him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62831:31"/>to a Deſire, but it cannot conſtrain him to the Act, both becauſe God hath given him <hi>Reaſon</hi> to bridle his <hi>Will,</hi> if he will make uſe of it, and will give him <hi>grace</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his Paſſion, if he will but ſeek for it.</p>
            <p>The Plea of <hi>Cannot,</hi> is a meer pretence, and that a groundleſs one; it is the <hi>Will not</hi> that is in fault. If poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be offered them in Meat or Drink, they can forbear that, if they know of it; and can they not as well forbear Fornication, which is as deſtructive to the Soul, as Poyſon to the Body? When their Luſt is never ſo hot, they can forbear while any body is by; and can they not then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear at all times, ſince God himſelf is always by them, and his holy Angels never from them? What they have a mind to ſave (their Wine, or any thing elſe they affect) they can keep well enough, and why not their Chaſtity? Undoubtedly as well that as any thing elſe, ſo the ſame care be uſed to keep that which is uſed to keep other things.</p>
            <p>No doubt, but in the height of their Luſt, a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as a great Summ of Mony, or the offer of a Crown or Kingdom, would hire them to contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or a great Danger would fright them into Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if they ſaw that after the Fact committed, they ſhould forthwith drop into a flaming Furnace; or if they ſaw that there were no place to commit it in, but a Bed of Fire, why then cannot Heaven allure them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence? Why cannot Hell affright them from Incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Heaven, which for Wealth and Glory, exceeds all Rewards; Hell, which for Horrour and Torment, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends all Pains.</p>
            <p>The moſt paſſionately amorous can contain for a time, upon Promiſe or hope of Enjoyment of his Pleaſure: And cannot he then, if he will, contain for always, when bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pleaſures and Enjoyments are aſſured to him upon his Continency, unto all Eternity? If upon any Conſideration he can contain for a Day, a Week, or for a Month, then why not for a longer time, even all his life long, upon a better Conſideration than any that can be made to him of things on Earth, even the but uſing to forbear for a while, will the better enable him for a total Forbearance; for as vicious, ſo virtuous Habits get ſtrength by uſe, and increaſe by continuance. Nor is it to be doubted, but where God ſees the Heart ſincerely ſet upon a good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62831:31"/>purpoſe, he will there ſet in with his Grace, and furniſh with Ability, and ſtrengthen unto performance.</p>
            <p>And how knows he that pleads the Impoſſibility of Continence, but that he may be chaſte, if he will? Did he ever take right Advice about it? Did he ever make a true Tryal of that Advice? Undoubtedly never any man made that Plea, that took right Advice, and made a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The Plea of Impoſſibility, is only made out of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to prevent Advice, and ſuperſede all Tryal, and is the higheſt piece of Sophiſtry that the Devil can cheat any man withal; for let him once work a man into a perſwaſion of that, and then the next News is, that the Reins of his Luſt are thrown into the Neck of him, and he rides full drive, without ſtop or ſtay, in a high Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer to Hell and Damnation.</p>
            <p>And now having blown away that thin Cob-web, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Impoſſibility of keeping this Precept of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, I ſhall go on with my intended Work, and give thoſe Directions, which, if faithfully and carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, will ſufficiently qualify any man to be Continent, and enable him to <hi>flee Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>firſt,</hi> Not to direct you to that courſe, which yet our Saviour tells us that ſome have taken for the <hi>Kingdom of Heavens ſake,</hi> and of which he alſo ſaith, <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it,</hi> Mat. 19.12. which <hi>Origen</hi> alſo in the primitive Times did, and made himſelf an Eunuch, becauſe there is no Virtue in, no Praiſe for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from that ſin which one is not able to commit, (tho the but bare freedom from ſo impetuous a Luſt, and ſo troubleſom a Temptation, might be worth all the Paln and Trouble of either a Phyſical Emaſculation, or a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Eviration,) I ſay, not to adviſe any to make an Eunuch of himſelf, I ſhall in the firſt place, to thoſe that are <hi>Unmarried,</hi> in order to their abſtaining from Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if otherwiſe they are not able to contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, give that Advice which the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. and that is, <hi>to marry.</hi> Having before, <hi>v.</hi> 8. acknowledged it good for them, if they did abide as he did; that is, keep themſelves unmarried; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he adds an Advice to marry, if they cannot otherwiſe keep themſelves chaſte: <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Tho ſingle Life may in ſome reſpect;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62831:32"/>be to be preferred before the married Condition, yet if any find not in themſelves ability and ſtrength to abſtain, and preſerve Chaſtity, let them marry in God's Name; it is infinitely better than ſo to do, and preſerve Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Chaſtity, than by rejecting the uſe of that Remedy, to be inflamed with vehement burning Deſire, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps break out into unnatural Practices. And hence our Church declaring the Cauſes for which Matrimony was ordained, tells us, that <hi>it was ordained</hi> (among other things) <hi>for a remedy againſt ſin, and to avoid Fornication, that ſuch perſons as have not the gift of continency, might marry, and keep themſelves undefiled members of Chriſt's Body.</hi> Thus<note n="*" place="bottom">De Abrah. Patriarch. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Ambroſe, Ideo conjugii tibi datum eſt jus, ne in laequeum incidas, &amp; cum alierâ muliere delinquas;</hi> Marriage is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed you to prevent your falling into a Snare, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fornication.

Here now for the ſatisfaction of Natural Deſires, and for the prevention of unlawful Practices, here, I ſay, is one Remedy for the Unmarried, ordained by God, approved by man both Chriſtian and Heathen; if they cannot otherwiſe contain, let them marry.</p>
            <p>But becauſe neither can all, at leaſt, not at all times, make uſe of this Remedy; and becauſe even this Remedy alone where it is had, is not enough with with ſome to keep them chaſte, I ſhall therefore go on to give you other Directions, and thoſe ſuch as will indifferently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all, whether married or unmarried.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Therefore in order to the flying of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, watch and quench the firſt <hi>Motins</hi> of the Spirit of Impurity within your ſelves; ſuppreſs and ſtifle the firſt Deſires and Thoughts of Uncleanneſs that ariſe in your Hearts. 'Tis eaſier to deal with a ſpark than with a flame, to cruſh an Egg, than kill a Cockatrice: A ſpark, if it get vent to quicken it, will rage to a flame; and the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice Egg, if it get warmth to hatch it, will break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Serpent; give no way to that which will ruine you,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62831:32"/>no life to that which will deſtroy you: <hi>Principis obſta;</hi> keep down the firſt riſings of the Fleſh, ſmother the firſt breathings of Luſt; choak the firſt Imaginations of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs; ſtrangle the firſt deſires of Impurity: Cut the throat of your Luſts in the Infancy of them, or daſh the brains of them againſt the Stones, any way get rid of them, and as ſoon as you can; let not a vain Thought have any lodging in your Boſom, not a carnal Deſire have any abiding in your Breaſt. The beginning of a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the time to ſhow our greateſt Valour and Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in. And therefore run the Sword of the Spirit to the Heart of Luſt in the very firſt appearance of it. Say to thy ſelf, the Law hath ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> thou ſhalt not luſt, and ſhall I give way to carnal Deſires, to fleſhly Luſts? I will not do it; avant, be gone away from me, ye vain Thoughts, yet unclean Motions, ye impure Imaginations, I will neither act, nor think of any ſuch thing. If with this Vigilancy you ſhall attend, with this Reſolution oppoſe, with this Courage ſet upon, deſign, and endeavour the deſtruction of Luſt in its firſt motions and apperances, you will, no doubt, have a noble and cheap Victory over it! you will overcome it, and ſubdue it with eaſe and certainty: But give it time, and it will ſoon grow too hard to be over-maſtered by you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hold no diſpute againſt any Temptations to Uncleanneſs: To diſpute with it, is the way to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by it, or highly endangered thro it: Arguments againſt it do but inrage it to come upon us with a ſharp point, or the keen edge of a more vigorous Reply. They will leave an ill reliſh upon the Tongue, and a bad ſmack upon the Fancy. Hear the Temptation but ſpeak for it ſelf, and before you are aware, it inſinuates it ſelf into the Boſom of you, and is in your Heart before you can think it got into your Head, with an unſeen Fire, and unſenſible Power, it melts you into ſoftneſs, and diſſolves you into yielding. Good therefore in this caſe is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of St. <hi>Auguſtine: Contra libidinis impetum apprehende fugam, ſi vis obtinere victoriam.</hi> So St. <hi>Ambroſe: Cum aliis vitiis poteſt expectari conflictùs, hanc fugite ne approximetis, quia non poteſt aliter melius vinci.</hi> Againſt a Temptation to Uncleanneſs, ſight is not ſo good as flight for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Victory. He that would conquer Fornication, muſt, (as our Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>flee Fornication;</hi> that is, fly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62831:33"/>the Temptation to it, ſtand no diſpute with it, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no conteſt againſt it, but wholly throw it off, and lay it aſide; give it no conſideration, but run away from it, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did from his tempting Miſtreſs. <hi>Non fugatur, niſi fugiatur;</hi> The only way to put it to flight, is to flee away from it. Had our Great Grandmother <hi>Eve</hi> done ſo at the firſt with the Devil's Temptation, had ſhe given no ear to his Words, ſet no eye upon the Fruit, held no diſpute with him, had no conſideration of that, but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf, and gone away from him and it, ſhe had not been the Mother of ſo much Sin and Miſery, as ſhe hath been to her Poſterity. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. <hi>the ground is curſed,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> condemned to eat in <hi>ſorrow of it all the days of his Life.</hi> What's the cauſe? why, becauſe he had <hi>hearkened unto the voice of his Wife,</hi> tempting him to eat of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit. He ſhould not have hearkened to any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to that, nay, (according to the Septuagints Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) he ſhould not have heard any Temptation to it. 'Tis there <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>becauſe thou haſt,</hi> not <hi>hearkened,</hi> as we read, but <hi>heard the voice of thy Wife.</hi> In order therefore to the avoiding of this ſin, neither hearken to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, nor ſo much as hear the voice of Temptation to it, but reject it; and (as <hi>Hercules</hi> did from the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Lybia,</hi> that had the faces of beautiful Women, but the Claws and Tails of cruel Serpents) run away from it, by turning your ſelf to ſober Thoughts, or betaking your ſelf to laudable buſineſs; as he ſaid in the Comedy, <hi>Aliquid agam, ne hoc agam;</hi> ſo do you, do ſomething, do any thing that you may not do this; that you may have no leiſure to act, or think of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>And if you be alone when the Temptation begins its aſſault upon you, abide no longer in that ſolitarineſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the place, and quit the field, as I may ſay, get into Company forthwith, but that ſuch, as by the gravity of it may awe you into Chaſtity; or by the chearfulneſs of it, may divert your Thoughts, and put the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quite out of your mind. In this caſe we may ſay by the Tempted, as God ſaid by <hi>Adam</hi> before <hi>Eve</hi> was created, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18.) <hi>It is not good for man to be alone.</hi> Yea, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Wo to him that is alone when be falleth,</hi> viz. into this temptation, if he ſeek not to get other Company to himſelf, to get himſelf into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men, or however to get God into Company with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62831:33"/>himſelf. Indeed to run to Men and God both, is beſt in ſuch caſes, to God for ſtrength againſt, and to Men for diverſion from the Temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Avoid all occaſions of Temptation to this ſin, all things that may externally provoke to luſt, or put in mind of it, inſtruct, or incourage to it: They are many, and ſome I ſhall mention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Avoid Society and Converſe with men that are given that way, and eſpecially at times and places, when and where they are to act their filthineſs, or but deſign to do it: Their Actions, their Words, their Geſtures have Miſchief in them, and are mighty to corrupt. If a Man touch Pitch, he ſhall be defiled therewith. Ye may ſooner hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Perſons that have the Plague, and not be infected by them, than to converſe with perſons given to laſcivicuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eſcape being corrupted and debauched among them; their evil Words will corrupt your good Manners. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith <hi>Menander:</hi> To converſe with thoſe that are naught, is the way for you to become naught your ſelf. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Malignas comes, quamvis candido &amp; fimplici rubiginem ſuam affricat;</hi> An ugly-condition'd Companion rubs the Ruſt of his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity upon him that is otherwiſe fair-condition'd, and plain-hearted, and infects him with it. With Wolves a man ſhall become to howl, and with Cripples to halt; ſuch Company, ſuch Companions: But of all ill Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, laſcivious ones are the worſt; like People that have the Plague on them, they deſire and delight, love and long to draw in others into the ſame Puddle and Sink of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with themſelves, to infect and poiſon them with the Venom of their own Vice, to debauch and corrupt them into the ſame lewdneſs of manners that themſelves are guilty of. Therefore as you would avoid the ſin of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſo avoid ſociety with Fornicators.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Avoid all Communication and Commerce with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of wanton Carriage and Converſation: No Danger more dangerous than that. Women (however accounted the weaker Veſſel) overthrew <hi>Sampſon</hi> the ſtrongeſt, and <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt, <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> the higheſt and ſtrongeſt of Heathen Gods. Their Arts to ſeduce are powerful and prevailing; their Temptations ſubtil and piercing; their Blandiſhments delicate and melting; their Words are charming, their Looks inchanting, their Kiſſes killing, their Hairs are Snares to take, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And therefore if you preſerve your Chriſtity, you muſt avoid ſuch venerous female Society. Prudent and exemplary was the carriage of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in this caſe, as it is ſet down in <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.10. whenno ſaying of his wanton tempting Miſtreſs nay, would ſerve her turn, he then avoided her preſence, and <hi>hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her:</hi> So muſt you do, if you mean to eſcape being ruined by them. Chaſtity among ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is as a Ship among Rocks; the firſt it touches upon, it ſplits. Have therefore no unneceſſary Commerce with them, no private Talks and Whiſpers in the Company of others; no cloſe Communications alone by your ſelves; touch them not with Lip or Hand, as you mean not to be taken and defiled with them; there's Pitch and Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime in their Lips and Fingers, and Itch of Amorouſneſs of Skin all over; and ye may as well hope to take Fire in your Boſom, and hug a Flame without being burnt, as to admit a rude Woman within your Embraces, and not be all on fire within with the heat of Luſt. (<hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus igitur modis laſcivae mulieris vitandus occurſus eſt,</hi> D. <hi>Ambroſ. in Apolog. Dand.</hi>) In a word, neither in preſence, nor at diſtance, by ſpeaking or writing, either make Courtſhip or Complement to them, or have any Converſe, or hold any Correſpondence with them, but utterly fly them, and avoid them as Dragons in the Shapes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Devils in the Bodies of Women, and with the Tongues and Faces of Virgins: In that ſhape, as <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> fancies, the Old Serpent deceived our firſt Parents, and with that ſhape he continues to this day to deſtroy their Poſterity: For as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Proverbs, <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The lips of a strange Woman drop as a Honey-comb, and her mouth is ſmoother than Oyl: But her end is bitter as Wormwood, ſharp as a two-edged Sword: Her feet go down to Death, her ſteps take hold of Hell:</hi> Thither at laſt ſhe goes her ſelf, and thither ſhe ſends and carries many more Feſides her.</p>
            <p>To put many things together for brevity ſake, avoid the ſpeaking of any wanton Words, and (if poſſible) the hearing of any ſpoken; alſo the reading of any laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

In a word, they are thoſe ſweet Baits with which the Devil baits his Hooks, and takes the precious Souls of men captive; firſt drawing them by thoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to ſin, and then dragging them, for their ſin, to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Have you beheld an ugly Spider ſpin a fine and curious Web, and take his Prey, and draw it into his Hole, and then devour it? Ye have ſeen an Image of the foul Devils laying theſe pleaſing and delightful Snares, and catching Souls therein, and haling them to Hell, and there deſtroying of them. And if ye like not the end of that Sport, then have nothing to do in the beginning of the Play; as ye would preſerve your Bodies pure from unchaſt Defilements, and both Souls and Bodies ſafe from the Damnation of Hell for being defiled, ſo avoid theſe Occaſions of Provocation to luſt after ſtrange Fleſh, and to commit the ſin of Fornication.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Flee <hi>Covetouſneſs. The love of money</hi> (the Apoſtle tells us) <hi>is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.10. of this Evil, no doubt, it is in many the very Root. Of old the Poets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed this in their fiction of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s raining himſelf into <hi>Danae</hi>'s Lap in a ſhower of Gold; as meaning thereby to ſhew what a Power there is in Gold to corrupt Chaſtity, and that the love of Money is the Root, as of other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo alſo of this of Fornication. And we ſee the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it every day, infinite almoſt every where, being diſſolved (thro the love of Money) into a willingneſs to conſent to the Act of Uncleanneſs, with much leſs than a ſhower of Gold rained into their Laps, even with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Gold or Silver, and perhaps a leſs quantity of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put into their Hands. How many Women do, for love of Money (like <hi>Flora</hi> of old among the <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Thais</hi> among the <hi>Grecians</hi>) proſtitute their Bodies to all Comers, that will go to, or give the Price of their Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms! Yea, (which is a ſhame to ſpeak) how many men are there, that for love of the ſame, do, as it were, let
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62831:35"/>themſelves out to hire for Stallions to ſatisfie the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Luſts of inſatiable, laſcivious, bruitiſh Wantons!

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is made uſe of in Scripture to ſignifie both, and as intimating that he that is given to one, may eaſily be drawn into the other; whereupon it follows, that ye muſt fly the one, if you mean not to follow the other; that ye muſt avoid Covetouſneſs, if ye purpoſe to fly Fornication.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fly <hi>Idleneſs.</hi> The Soul of man is a buſie thing, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be doing; it muſt, it will have ſome Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if it have no good, it will have evil. The idle man therefore that finds his Soul nothing of good to imploy it ſelf about, gives it leiſure, and opportunity, and a temptation to let it ſelf looſe unto Vanity, and to give Entertainment unto wanton Imaginations, laſcivious and luſtful Thoughts, upon the firſt, and every occaſion of ſuch thinking.</p>
            <p>And again, the Body of man, by the labour of buſineſs and exerciſe, is freed much from the ſuperfluity of thoſe Humours, which are the Fomes and Fuel of Luſt. But where this is wanting, there the ſuperfluity of that naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs is ſo great, as that like a Coal-mine that is fired within it ſelf by the abundance of ſulphureous and bitumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter immixed with it, it heats and kindles in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails, and rages within the Breaſt and Boſom, and burns throughtout the whole Body.</p>
            <p>As therefore a man of Buſineſs and Labours is ſeldom much given, if any thing inclined to this ſin, ſo on the other ſide it is obſerved, that no eaſie, healthful, and idle perſon ever was chaſt, if he could be tempted.

And every days experience doth ſo confirm this, that I ſpare further labour to prove it; only mentioning to you one Example, which I chiefly chooſe to ſpeak of, becauſe it is ſo notorious: It is recorded by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 33 <hi>Serm. ad Fr.</hi> in <hi>Er.</hi> of the Son of one <hi>Cyril,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Citizen of <hi>Hippo,</hi> who had a Son whom he loved even above his Maker, not contradicting him in any Deſire, nor correcting him for any Fault. This riotous youngſter, not content to roar it abroad, and ſpend his Father's Eſtate, comes home drunk, and (now mark and remember all, eſpecially fondly indulgent Parents) he villanouſly raviſhed his own Mother big with Child; one of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters he endeavoured to deflower, two of them he wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they died; and for his Father, him he killed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. A terrible Example to all Drunkards, and enough ſure to wound any Heart that is not cauterized, to a ſerious abomination of ſo exceedingly ſinful a ſin as Drunkenneſs is. Avoid Drunkenneſs therefore, if you would not be guilty of Whoredom; and follow not that, as ye would flee Fornication.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Flee <hi>Gluttony.</hi> Gluttony and Drunkenneſs were ancient Companions, and grow too much to be again ſo in theſe days: And well might they go ſo, inaſmuch as the one as well as the other, is an incentive to laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Jeſurun waxed fat and kicked,</hi> that is, waxed wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton upon his high feeding, <hi>Deut.</hi> 35.15. it is a Metaphor taken from fat wanton Horſes. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.8. <hi>They were as fed Horſes in the morning: every one neighed after his Neighbours Wife.</hi> High feeding is a great Incendiary unto hot luſting; it fills the Body with ſuperfluous Nutriment, Spirits, and Moiſture, which are the ſuel of Luſt. Whence St. <hi>Hieron.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Difficile inter Epulas ervatur pudicitia:</hi> And St. <hi>Bernard, Periclitatur caſtitas in deliciis:</hi> It is a hard thing to feed high, and keep chaſtity, which is in great danger by the delicateſt fare. For as <hi>Ericius Putecinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Paſcitur libido convitiis, nutritur deliciis;</hi> Lnſt is fed with Feaſts, and nouriſhed with Dainties. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.6. it is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62831:37"/>ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that <hi>they ſate down to eat, and to drink, and roſe up to play,</hi> i. e. to play the Wantons, to play the Whoremaſters, to commit Fornication, and to act unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Uncleanneſſes, as were uſual for Idol-worſhippers to commit, and act at, and after their Idol-feaſts. They did ſo then, and they do not much otherwiſe now; they eat, and drink and riſe up to play, and too much of their Play is of this kind, even playing the Whores and Woremaſters, and committing filthineſs one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore if you would not be given to Luſt, be not given to Gluttony; avoid not only the uſe of all ſalacious Food, and luſtful Meat, but all inordinate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, intemperate feeding on any Meat. <hi>Nunquam vidi continentem, quem non vidi abſtinentem;</hi> He is never conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that hath not been abſtinent. And therefore follow not Gluttony, if ye would flee Fornication. And thus much for my fifth Direction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Exerciſe Mortifications upon your Body, in order to the ſubduing of your Fleſh: This is an old, and approved Remedy, the ſucceſs whereof, upon trial, hath worthily been recommended to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Uſe <hi>frequent Faſtings,</hi> not from ſome kind of Food only, but from all, either Meat or Drink, and thoſe of ſome ſtrength and continuance, and that not when we are unable to eat, but are deſirous of Meat, like the Faſts we read of kept by the Saints in the Scripture, which were continued for ſome days, in which they did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor drink, that is, not until Night, and that which they took then, was very little, and of mean qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a bit of Bread, courſe Bread, and a draught of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho' ſome, I ſuppoſe, did even forbear from that too, neither eating Bread, nor drinking Water. This is a way that will bring the Body low enough in time, and humble the Fleſh, and quench Luſt. <hi>Sine Cerere &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero friget Venus,</hi> ſo the <hi>Comaedian</hi> obſerved, Take away Diet and Drink, the Fuel of Luſt, and the Heat of it will abate, and the Fire of it goeth out.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Body cannot be maintained either in Health or Life without ſome Food, and ſo there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of eating, let your ordinary and conſtant feeding be for the quantity of it, very ſparing, and for the quality of it, mean and courſe; no matter how unpleaſant, ſo it be not unhealthful. <hi>Sumenda ſunt alimenta tanquam medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camenta;</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:62831:38"/>We muſt in this caſe take Meat like Medicines, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid; no more than needs muſt to keep us alive, and preſerve us in health.<note n="*" place="bottom">S. Bernard.</note> 
               <hi>Sufficit ut comeſtabilia ſint non concupiſcibilia;</hi> 'Tis enough, that what we eat be wholſom, tho' it be not toothſom. Thus by often forbearances to eat at all, and a conſtant thin Diet, little and mean when we eat, we ſhall ſtarve Luſt, and ſubdue our Fleſh, and bring that Enemy of ours, (like a Town pined out with a long Siege) to our own terms. And that none may think this Preſcription unpreacticable, this was the way of <hi>Eremiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Living in former Ages, whereof infinite Inſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of <hi>Antonius</hi> the Inſtitutor of that kind of life, might be given, if it would not ſwell this part too much.</p>
            <p>And if yet the ſtubborn Rebel Luſt lift up his head, and make oppoſition, then uſe ſome ſharpneſs to him, handle him with ſeverity, put him to pain, cauſe him to feel ſmart; either by long lyings on the ground, or by praying in painful Poſtures, as on hard ſtones with bare Knees and extended Arms; or elſe by wearing Sackcloth, or Hair-ſhirts upon their Fleſh, or by inflicting of heavy ſtripes on the Body with the Rod, or Whip, or the like.</p>
            <p>This is a Courſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to take with himſelf; and indeed ſo ſaith he himſelf in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I ſtrike my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and get it under me; ſtrike it, and that with ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like as a Cuffer ſtrikes his Adverſary, till I make it black and blew again; yea, till I wound it ſo, that the Wounds do rot again, as our Criticks deſcant on the Text:<note n="a" place="bottom">S. Benedictus.</note> One for this end tumbled himſelf among Thorns;<note n="b" place="bottom">S. Martiniamus.</note> Another burned his Face and Hands:<note n="c" place="bottom">S. Johannes cognomento Bonus.</note> A third ran ſharp prickles up his Fingers between the fleſh and he nails. And it wee a thouſand times better that we did by any, tho' never ſo afflicting a Courſe, ſubdue our Fleſh, conquer our Luſt, and preſerve our Chaſtity, than that we did pamper our Bodies, yield to our Luſt, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62831:38"/>commit Fornication, and for ſuch commiſſion to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to lie under Satan's laſh for ever in Hell, to be torn and tormented with his fiery Whips, and flaming Scourges to all Eternity. Better forbear any thing, do any thing, ſuffer any thing to avoid this ſin, than for not avoiding it now, go to Hell hereafter, and lie, and live, or rather die in Torments for it for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And thus much for my ſixth Direction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Meditate upon ſuch things as may by the Conſideration of them, be apt to withhold you from the Commiſſion of that ſin. Want of due Conſideration is in many the Cauſe of this, and many other ſinful Commiſſions. To preſerve you therefore from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this ſin, meditate and conſider: You may ask, What? and I ſhall anſwer, that there be many things to be thought of, in order to this end, and ſome of the chiefeſt I will offer to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Call to mind and conſider of the <hi>Falls of others</hi> that have miſcarried in this way; as of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> men famous in their Generation, for Strength, Valour, Wiſdom, and ſee to what weakneſs of Body, and poorneſs of Spirit, and fooliſhneſs of Mind they were brought to by this ſin, and be afraid of that which was too hard for them; avoid that which was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of them. <hi>Optimum eſt alienâ frui inſaniâ;</hi> It is a ſine thing to get good by others hurt, to learn wiſdom from other mens folly, to grow careful for our own ſtandings by the conſideration of other mens fallings; let us make this uſe of their Examples, and get this good by their harms, to fly that thro which they fell: Let us look upon their falls, as ſo many Beacons ſet up upon Rocks in the Sea, as ſo many Marks of Cautions for us to avoid that ſin which was their overthrow: And let us not add to the Triumphs of ſin, nor to the Trophies of Luſt, and be made ſuch Spectacles for others to look on and loath, as others have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider and meditate upon the <hi>Conſtancy of others</hi> that have held out unconquered by this Luſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Temptations to it. The moſt notable one that we can mention, is that of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> recorded in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62831:39"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.7, to 13. <hi>He was tempted</hi> to it by his Miſtreſs, who had ſome Power to command him, and many ways to oblige him, yet he <hi>conſented not. He was tempted to it,</hi> not by Looks and Glances, Hints and Intimations, (any of which were enough with too many in theſe our days, to draw them to it) but with downright words, ſhe plainly and boldly ſaid to him, <hi>Lie with me;</hi> and <hi>yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented not. He was tempted to it</hi> by her, not once or twice only, (for tryal of him, as might be thought) but many times, to ſhew ſhe was in earneſt; ſhe was often at it with him, tempting him, ſhe ſpake to <hi>Joſeph</hi> day by day, and yet <hi>he confented not, He was tempted to it</hi> by her, not at unſeaſonable times only, while Company was at home, whereby they might be diſcovered and deſcryed, but at a time of greateſt ſeaſonableneſs and opportunity, when he might act the thing with greateſt ſecrecy and ſecurity, when he had buſineſs to do within the Houſe, and <hi>there was none of the men of the houſe there within;</hi> and <hi>yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented not. He was tempted to it</hi> by her, not only by winning Speech, but by enforcing Action; ſhe not only uſed Speech to him, but laid hand on him, ſhe caught him by his Garment, ſaying, <hi>Lie with me,</hi> and <hi>yet he conſented not.</hi> Here's a noble Example of Conſtancy and Chaſtity, as well worthy of our Imitation, as deſerving our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Let this be ever in our Memories and Minds, whenever our Chaſtity is aſſaulted, and indangered by any ſuch Temptation. Not much unlike was that which St. <hi>Hierome</hi> reports of a Son of a <hi>King of Nicomedia,</hi> who being tempted upon Flowers, and a perfumed Bed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was tied, by an impure Curteſan with all the Arts, and Circumſtances of Luxury, leſt the eaſe of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſhould abuſe him to a yielding to her Temptations, bit off his Tongue, and ſpit it in her Face. If ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Examples as theſe be made familiar to your mind by freqeunt Meditation on them, they will come in as Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries upon occaſion, to help you toward the Victory over every Temptation that may be offered to you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Fornication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider of, and meditate, <hi>What that thing is,</hi> whoſe Enjoyment is ſo luſted after; and how lovely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it appear; to the Eye, there is enough in it, if well conſidered of, to make it loathſom to the mind. I will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62831:39"/>give you this Conſideration in the Senſe of St. <hi>Chryſoſom</hi>'s Words: Saith he, <q>When thou ſeeſt a fair Woman that hath a twinkling Eye, and a ſmiling Face, a Look plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, attractive and amiable, ſuch as putteth thy Heart into a heat, and ſets thy Deſires all on fire, think with thy ſelf, that that thing which ſo raviſheth thee, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Earth; and that the fire wherewith thou art burned, is nothing elſe but Dung; and then the heat of thy fury will be aſſwaged. Unmask her of the skin of her Face, and look under, or within that, and thou ſhalt ſee all the vileneſs of that goodly ſhew. Gaze not with the Eye of thy Body upon the out-ſide of her, but pierce with the Eye of thy Mind upon that which is within, and what elſe ſhalt thou ſee there, but Bones, Sinews, and Veins?</q> And yet is not this enough? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Beauty changeth, groweth old, and withereth; that the quickneſs of the Eyes wax dim and dead, that the Cheeks grow hollow, and all that fair Flower paſſeth away. See what that is, that, as it were, maketh a Beaſt of thee: It is Aſhes, Duſt, and Filth that thou art burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. For of this Beauty which thou ſeeſt, what is it but Snot, Spittle, corrupt Blood, and the juyce of rotten Nouriſhment? What cometh there elſe out of the Ears, Eyes, Noſe or Mouth? And if theſe Vacuations, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Defluxions of Excrements ſhall ceaſe, and the Breaſt, Liver, and Brain ceaſe to be purged that way, all this goodly ſhew declineth, and goes to decay; the Skin ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and the Eyes ſink down into the Head. Whereupon if thou conſider what is in the bottom of theſe goodly Eyes, what is within that fair and ſtraight Noſe, what within the Mouth, and under the Cheeks, thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that this ſo amiable a Body is nothing elſe but a whited Sepulchre, wherein all is full of filthineſs, and of rottenneſs, and of ſtink. He therefore that is ſo taken with the outward Beauty, that upon ſight of a fair Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he becomes fond, and is like a Body without a Soul, would he but conſider that which ſo tranſporteth him, he would find the foulneſs of it to be ſuch indeed, as he would not endure another ſhould name to him in word. Many, as air as ſhe, when once dead, within a few hours ſtink, and rot, and are the Food of Lice and Worms. Therefore bethink with thy ſelf a while, when thou art under Temptation to Uncleanneſs, what a buſineſs that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62831:40"/>Beauty is, which thou ſo doateſt upon, and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, will very much allay thy heat, and cool thy deſire, and even daſh thee out of Countenance. For there is nothing certainly that ſo much maſtereth the deſire of the Fleſh, as to think what that which one loveth, is, after once it be dead. And the Experience hereof, we have in that <hi>Hermit,</hi> who underſtanding that a Woman, whom he was too too much enamoured on, was dead, went by night to her Grave, and having opened it, with the lap of his Mantle wiped away ſome of the filth of the dead Corps, being half rotten, and when afterwards he found himſelf pricked with any unlawful deſires, he laid abroad his foul and ſtinking Mantle, he ſaid thus to himſelf; <hi>Go to now, ſee what it is that thou doſt deſire, and take thy fill of it.</hi> By which means his Heart was cooled, his Deſire damped, and his Luſt quenched. And no doubt but this Conſideration will be found again (what it hath proved heretofore) to thoſe that ſhall make trial of it, very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant towards the enabling any ſo conſidering Perſon to keep the Apoſtolical Precept, and to <hi>flee Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider that you cannot act this ſin, but there will be <hi>Eyes</hi> upon you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Eye of God</hi> is upon you: The Eye of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing and Almighty, the Eye of the moſt holy, and moſt juſt God is ever uon you; and if you ſhall commit For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication at any time, you cannot commit it any where, but in his Preſence. Should you aſcend up into Heaven he is there; ſhouldyou make your Bed in Hell, behold, he is there; ſhould you take the wings of the morning, and flee to th uttermoſt parts of the Sea, even there will his Eye be uon you to behold you; ſhould you ſay, <hi>ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the darkneſs ſhall cover us, even the night ſhall be light about you. Yea, the darkneſs hideth not from God, but the Night ſhineth as the Day, the darkneſs and light are both alike to him,</hi> (as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.8, 9.10, 11, 12. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in every place,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3.) <hi>beholding the evil and the good;</hi> no poſſibility of eſcaping his ſight, if ye ſhould attempt the committing of any ſuch fact. And who that hath ſeriouſly conſidered of this, could ever have the conſidence to do any ſuch thing? Would he not be afraid to act ſuch filthines in the ſight
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62831:40"/>of that great God that is mighty and terrible? to uncover the nakedneſs of his Body in the preſence of that holy God, in whoſe preſence the Seraphims cover their Faces? Sure he would.</p>
            <p>In a Fury, or in a Frolick, or for ſome politick pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſuch a like thing as this may be acted in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a man; as it once happened in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where a <hi>Tarlaquin</hi> tranſported with beaſtly fury ran at a Woman as ſhe came out of the Stove, laid hold of her, threw her on the ground, and notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance ſhe made, had carnal knowledge of her in the preſence of many Spectators. And ſo we read in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.22. how to make the breach irreparable between <hi>Abſolom</hi> and his Father <hi>David; Abſolom ſpread a tent upon the top of the Houſe, and went in unto his Father's Concubines in the ſight of all Iſrael.</hi> The like Wickedneſs hath been ſaid in theſe days of impudent ſinning to have been committed in the light of the Day, and in the ſight of men, and upon the top of an houſe, even in <hi>England,</hi> that no Age or Place might outdo the preſent for abominable Wickedneſs, and for ſhameleſs Debauch.</p>
            <p>Yet generally in men that have not utteriy defaced all the common Notices of God, wich Nature's hand hath written in the Heart of man, ſecrecy for time, and for place, is ſought out for the acting of this ſin, and the greateſt care imaginable is taken, that no Eye may ſee, that no Ear may hear, that no Perſon may know: It will not be acted in the view, even of thoſe Pimps and Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe's, who are the moſt inſtrumental to bring the Actors of it together.</p>
            <p>Now ſurely, if the Eye of man be not to be endured in the commiſſion of this ſin, much leſs ſhould any be able to endure the Eye of God upon him whilſt he commits this ſin. To think then that it is impoſſible to act it in any place, but where the Eye of God muſt look full and broad upon you, whilſt you are in the Act, muſt needs be an amazing, and a terrifying Conſideration, enough to ſtop and hinder you from the doing, of any ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, and which God ſo hates.</p>
            <p>And indeed the experience of this Conſideration's effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualneſs, I have heard made by one, who being wearied with the Sollicitations of a tempting <hi>Dalilah,</hi> at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Act, provided it might be committed where
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62831:41"/>they might not be ſeen .Whereupon being brought into one room, he alledged they might be ſeen from this place, and in another, that they might be ſeen in that place; and ſtill found ſome exception upon that account; but at laſt being brought into ſuch a place where could be no reaſon for ſuch Plea, yet he alledged, that it was not ſo ſecret, but that the Eye of God would be upon them even there, and that unleſs his Eye too, as well as all others, could be ſhut out, he durſt not do it; by which means he preſerved his Integrity from violation. So ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual is this Conſideration towards the preventing of the Commiſſion of this ſin.</p>
            <p>And therefore St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was pleaſed himſelf to take notice of it: <hi>Putas te ſolum eſſe cum fornicaris, &amp; non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordans, quia oculi Domini vident orbem terrarum?</hi> Do you think you are alone, all in ſecret, when you are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fornication? And do you not call to mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Eyes of the Lord have this World, and all the things contained therein, within the view and proſpect of them? Which is, as if he had ſaid, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and conſider that the Eye of God will be upon you in the commiſſion, is enough to perſwade you to fly Fornication. O, remember therefore, if ever you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Temptation to this ſin, that ye cannot do it but in the ſight of God; and that Thought will, no doubt, be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailing with you to forbear ſo ſinful an Act; you will not dare to do ſuch filthineſs in the ſight of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Purity; you will not be ſo impudent as to put ſo high an Affront upon his ſacred Majeſty, as to act Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in his preſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſide the Eye of God upon you, who is to be your Judge, you have alſo the <hi>preſence of Satan</hi> with you, who does mean to be your Accuſer. The Devil is Pimp Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to the World, not a piece of filthineſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, not an act of Fornication done in it, but he is as one at it by his Enticements and Pimperies helping to it. <hi>Ipſe ſuggerit &amp; miniſtrat fomenta luxuriae;</hi> He finds and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes with fuel for Luſt. And as he knows all ye do now, ſo he will tell all ye have done hereafter, both where, and when, and with whom, and how oft ye have committed that ſin. As therefore you would not have him accuſe you of it hereafter, ſo dread to commit it in his preſence here. As he now tempts you to it, ſo he will
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62831:41"/>be with you at the doing of it, and afterwards accuſe you for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Even the <hi>Angels of God,</hi> who loath to behold you in it, yet do, and will take ſo much notice of you at it, as that they will be Witneſſes againſt you, when you ſhall come to be judged for it: They will with Grief and Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation declare, how that, whereas they were deputed to guard you from Temptation, you refuſed to hearken to their Perſwadings of you to the contrary; and by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſs and filthineſs of your Converſation, drave them to forſake their Station, and relinquiſh their Charge, and leave you to your ſelves, to be made a Slave to Satan and Luſt, and to commit Fornication.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beſides the Eyes of all without you, there is <hi>the Eye of your Conſcience</hi> within you, which will alſo be one day a thouſand Witneſſes againſt you. The Apprehenſion of which, were there nothing elſe, were enough to deterr from ſo foul a fact. Your own Conſcience, without other Accuſer, Witneſs, or Judge, will accuſe, convict, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you: Nay more, it will not only be Accuſer, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Judge, but Executioner too. O, how it will laſh and ſcourge you both now and hereafter! the gripings of it for preſent, are very terrible, but the gnawings of it for future, will be intollerable. It makes a Hell of your Heart here, and will be another Hell to your Heart in the midſt of Hell hereafter; for there the Worm doth no more die, than the Fire is quenched. This the purblind <hi>Heathens</hi> were ſenſible of, and repreſented under the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thological Fictions of the Livers of <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> continually gnawed upon, and eaten up, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſumption thereof, by an Eagle and Vultur. <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerati, conſcientiâ obſtrepente, condormire non poſſunt, agitant eos furiae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philotas</hi> in <hi>Curtius;</hi> Wicked Men cannot ſleep in quiet for their Conſcience, which haunts and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies them like Furies.

               </gap>, a kind of God to all men; that is, Gods Viceroy and Deputy, as it were, placed by him in, and over men, to ſee and cenſure, correct and condemn men for their Vices and Wickedneſs. Having then Eyes, ſuch, and ſo many, as well within you, as without you, all upon you in every act of filthineſs you commit, how can you, if you but take it into any Conſideration, be able to do a thing of ſo much loathſomneſs in the ſight and preſence, in the view and beholding of ſo many, and thoſe ſuch Eyes! Think but of this, and think of it well, and by the thought of it, with the Concurrence of God's Grace, you will be able to overcome all Temptations to Luſt, and to <hi>flee Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider of, and meditate upon <hi>what is behind.</hi> Let the <hi>laſt Things</hi> come into your Thoughts, when you are under any Temptation to ſin, and eſpecially to the ſin of Uncleanneſs of any ſort; and the thought of them will be mightily conducing towards your preſervation from that, or any other ſin. What are they? Why, they are four, <hi>Death, Judgment, Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> and the ſerious Thought of any one of theſe, is enough to give a ſtop to the Courſe of any Sinner in the height of his moſt eager Purſuit and Career to ſin.</p>
            <p>Fornicator, Adulterer, unclean perſon of any ſort, <hi>Death</hi> is behind. Thou cauſt not live for ever here, thou muſt die; and die thou mayſt thou knoweſt not how ſoon, even in the very act of thy Uncleanneſs thou mayſt expire, and be cut off; and, O how diſmal would thy Condition be, if that ſhould befall thee! What can befall a man more woful and dreadful, than to be catcht, and cut off by Death in the very Act of ſin? And yet how many have been ſo ſurprized, and ſeized upon, taken and carried away by Death! And what hath befaln any, may juſtly be feared by all. Remember thy end therefore, and be afraid of ſuch an end as this, to be cut off at once both for ſin, and in ſin; and this will much conduce to a making
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62831:42"/>thee fearful to commit this, or any other ſin.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> not Death only, but <hi>Judgment</hi> alſo is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. Thou Adulterer, Fornicator, unclean Perſon, thou muſt not only die, but be judged too for thy filthineſs and uncleanneſs after Death: For <hi>Whoemongers and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers God will judge,</hi> Heb. 13.4. Death will not ſo hit thee as to make an end of thee; it will but ſeize on thee like a Serjeant, and impriſon thee until the general Goal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivery at the end of the World, and then it will bring thee forth to Tryal, and ſo, and in ſuch a caſe as it found thee, it will bring thee forth to the great Tribunal, and preſent thee to be judged by the great God, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge of quick and dead, in the ſight of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Who would not tremble, and be amazed to think of it, that he ſhould be brought forth, and made appear in ſuch an Aſſembly as will be at that great Aſſize at the end of the World, in that Condition that he is in, when he is in the act of his lewdneſs, and in all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his filthineſs? O, think of it, that in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you may be brought into that Aſſembly, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be aſſured, but that in that Condition you ſhall be brought into it: And ſuch a Thought, if well rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated upon, may be highly conducible to the prevailing with men to <hi>flee Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, <hi>thirdly,</hi> there's <hi>Heaven behind.</hi> And, Oh, what have I ſaid, when I ſaid Heaven! Why, I ſaid a Place, and a State of Pleaſure, Joy, Glory, and Happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that the World hath, or ever had, or was ſo much as ſaid, or thought, fancied, or imagined by any man in it: As it is written in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The Poets <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> the Garden of <hi>Aloadine,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> are, yea, the <hi>Eden</hi> of God in this World was nothing to it. The ſumm of it is full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of higheſt Bleſſedneſs, without interruption or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement, to all Eternity. But who is this for? Why, for the Godly, and amongſt them, for thoſe that poſſeſs their Veſſel unto Sanctification, and in Honour, that defile not themſelves with Women: For <hi>neither Fornicators, nor Adulterers, nor Idolaters, nor effeminate Perſons, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. And therefore think of this, when
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62831:43"/>at any time you are tempted to Uncleanneſs, and ſay, Shall I, for the love of a Whore, loſe my Heaven? loſe my Happineſs? Can the pleaſure of all the Beauties in the World (had I the Enjoyment of them all) countervail the loſs of Heaven? Is not one days fruition of Heavens Joys, beyond a Year, yea, a life ſpent it bruitiſh Pleaſures? If ye would but remember, and ſhew your ſelves men, and act according to right reaſon, you would conclude Heaven too good to be forfeited upon ſo ſilly a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as the Pleaſure which Bruits have one with another; and ſo would by that Conſideration, be mightily forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt the Temptations, which you may be aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to uncleanneſs, and much enabled to abſtain from all the ſins of the fleſh, and to flee Fornication.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is <hi>Hell</hi> behind. O, what is that! Why, a Place and State of perfect Miſery, where is an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of all Comfort, and an exquiſite infliction of bittereſt Torment; where is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing to Teeth; where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched; where the damned are implunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone that burneth to Eternity, for ever living in the Extremities of the moſt dolorous and tormenting Pains. And who are to be turned into this? Why, the Wicked, and amongſt the reſt, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Adulterers, and ſuch like Defilers of the Image of God, and Members of Chriſt, and Temple of the Holy Ghoſt. There in that Lake that burns with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, is their part ſet out to be. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7.) And this ſhall they have at Gods hand for their Wickedneſs, that they ſhall lie down in Sorrow, and burn in the Sparks of their own kindling for evermore. Now certainly if this were well thought of, and conſidered by any man that were under Temptation to uncleanneſs, he would never be ſo far overcome with the Luſt, ſo as to commit the ſin. What? ſhall I go to Hell for a Whore? Have I a mind to be damned for a Doxie? Shall I plunge my ſelf into Fire and Brimſtone, there to lie and burn, and roar to all Eternity, for the little, ſhort, naſty Pleaſure, which is had in the Embraces of a Strumpet? Thus, thus at any time when you come under the Temptations of Luſt, call to mind, and meditate a while upon this, and all the other three laſt things, <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and you will (by Gods Grace) be ſo wrought on in that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62831:43"/>and Conſideration, that you will both fly the Acts, and deteſt the Thought of any ſuch thing, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all appearance of that evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Conſider and meditate upon the <hi>Purity, Paſſion,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt: There is Argument in all to perſwade to Continency and Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>It was a life of <hi>Purity</hi> that Chriſt led; there was not the leaſt Unchaſtity either acted, ſyllabled, or imagined, done, ſaid, or thought by him. And his Life is that great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar which we are to copy out in our Converſation. <hi>He that ſaith he ahideth in him, ought himſelf to walk as he walked.</hi> When therefore you are at any time under Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to this ſin, thus ſay with, and to your ſelves, And is this to be Partaker of Chriſt's Holineſs? Is this to be conformable to Chriſt's Purity? Did he ever any thing of, or like to this kind of acting? Was he either a Deflowerer of Maids, or a Corrupter of Wives? an Actor of, or a Tempter to Uncleanneſs? Where read ye any thing of his gallanting it to Ladies? or ſo much as amorous court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or be-complementing of Women? To think then how unſuitable ſuch acting is unto the Converſation of Chriſt, and how diſagreeing with his Purity all manner of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, may be one good Conſideration to reſtrain us from all Impurity, and to perſwade to retain our Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>Again, Bitter was the <hi>Paſſion</hi> that Chriſt ſuffered; Scoffs and Scorns, Staves and Whips, Nails and Thorns; in one word, the Croſs; the ignominious, cruel, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Death on that, he endured. But what was all this for? Why to redeem us from the guilt of ſin, that we might not be damned after our Repentance, for what had paſſed before our repenting; and not that only, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us alſo from the filth of ſin, that being made whole by his Stripes, we ſhould ſin no more. So the Apoſtle expreſly, <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and puriſie unto himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works,</hi> Tit. 3.14. And now did Chriſt ſuffer for all, and ſo for this ſin of ours, and ſhall we again do that that he ſuffered for? Shall we bring upon our ſelves that Guilt and Filth which he ſhed his precious Blood to cleanſe us from? How ſhall we not only render his Paſſion fruitleſs, and in vain, as to any good to our ſelves by it, but alſo ſhew our ſelves moſt unworthy, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62831:44"/>ingrateful towards him in crucifying him afreſh, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him over again unto an open Shame, and trampling his Blood even under our Feet, as an inſignificant thing. When therefore we are under any Temptation to this ſin, to think a while calmly and cooly with our ſelves, if we can get but ſo much time to think thus; This that I am a going to act, is that which brought Jeſus to his Death; that which God was ſo much angred with, that he was no way to be appeaſed for it, but by the Death of his Son: This is that that Jeſus died to redeem me from, that I might not act it, but preſerving my Veſſel in Sanctification and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſhall I be ſo wicked, and ſo unworthy, as notwithſtanding all this, to act it? Thus to meditate on his Paſſion, might b e a means ſo to crucifie our Luſt, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our Fleſh, and ſubdue our Paſſions, that we ſhould remain in our Integrity, and perſevere in our Chaſtity, abhor, and flee from Fornication.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Infinite was the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt that brought him, being ſo pure in Life, to undergo ſuch a Paſſion at his Death; and to undergo it not for any Offence of his own, but all for love of us, to ſave us from our ſins, to redeem us from our Iniquities, to deliver us from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of them in our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and to deliver us from the <hi>filth</hi> of them in our <hi>Sanctification;</hi> and ſo to make us Members of himſelf, to joyn us to his own Body, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Partakers of his Holineſs here, we might be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Happineſs hereafter. Has he had, has he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch Love to us? and ſhall we then act that which is ſo hateful to him? Cannot all the Love that he hath ſhewn us, engage us to abſtain from that which he ſo much abhors? Shall we violate the Temple of his Spirit? Shall <hi>we take the members of Chriſt,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>and make them the members of an Harlot?</hi> Shall we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the enjoyment of a Luſt before Communion with Chriſt? and love a Whore better than Jeſus? better than Jeſus that ſo loved us, as not to love himſelf even to the Death for us, but give his Life for us? <hi>God forbid.</hi> If we thus would meditate on the Love of Chriſt, when we are under Temptation to uncleanneſs, the Love of Chriſt would damp and dead all other Love, ſubdue, and cruecifie, and kill all carnal Luſt. We ſhould never be able to love any thing in competition with him, much leſs luſt after any thing in Contradiction to him, and ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62831:44"/>from all uncleanneſs, deteſt and flee Fornication. And thus much for my ſeventh Direction.</p>
            <p>There is but one thing more that I know of, requiſite to give you for a Direction, and that is Prayer. Prayer! O, what will not that do! It hath a kind of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in it; it can do any thing, even with God himſelf; he cannot, becauſe he will not reſiſt it. Fervent and <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Prayer,</hi> O, it <hi>Availeth much!</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 16. To this means therefore betake your ſelves for Preſervation of your Chaſtity, and for Protection againſt Temptation to Incontinency. 'Tis our Saviou'rs own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation,</hi> Mat. 26.11. Nothing ſo forcible for the overcoming of this Temptation, as Prayer. Surely never was any man foiled with it, that uſed this Weapon againſt it, and did not firſt forſake his Weapon, and give over his Defence. Whatever therefore elſe ye do, be ſure to betake your ſelf to Prayer. Prayer will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and concern God himſelf in your Preſervation, and engage his Omnipotency in your Quarrel. It will obtain Grace to ſubdue Luſt, ſtrength to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Satan, Conſtancy to continue chaſte, and in one word, conqueſt in, and over every Temptation. To this weapon therefore betake your ſelves, and doubt not of Succeſs in every Encounter. He was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finally overcome by Luſt, who continued praying ſincerely.</p>
            <p>And now I have given you my Directions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from falling into the Sin of Fornication, I muſt now leave the Readers to the Tryal of them. and my Prayer is, That God would ſo bring theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections into your Minds, and ſo incline your Hearts to the uſing of them, and ſo bleſs your Endeavours in their Uſe, that they prove as ſo many powerful Antidotes againſt Luſt, ſtrong Remedies againſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and effectual Preſervatives againſt Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So ſhall God have Glory, ſo ſhall you have Profit, and I ſhall have the and I propounded to my ſelf in this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:62831:45"/>
            <p> And all this, and much more the Lord be pleaſed to do for you and me, and all for the Son of his Love's ſake, our ever bleſſed Lord, and only Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour, Glory, and Power, aſcribed now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
